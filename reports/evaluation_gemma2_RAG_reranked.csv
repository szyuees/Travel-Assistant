The ice with round holes is made by commercial ice makers who purify their water. However, restaurants or stalls which buy a big block of ice and chip bits off of it for your drink may be suspect.

What is the best way to get around Bangkok?,"Bangkok offers multiple transport options including BTS Skytrain, MRT subway, and river ferries. Avoid rush hours if possible, as road traffic can be heavy.","The best way to get around Bangkok is by boat [4]. 

**Explanation:**

The text states that ""Getting around this vast district is sure to give you a headache. The locals use their own transport for attractions that lie too far off a boat pier or ARL station. Of course, metered taxis are abundant, but expect long rides and high fares (especially during rush hour). Buses are cheaper, but without a decent bus map, you are sure to get lost."" [4] 

The text also mentions that ""By boat is the best way to get to and around the Bang Rak area."" [5]","[""f helmets is far from universal. A helmet should be provided when hiring a motorbike or moped, and two if there are two of you. When riding, keep a firm grasp on the seat handle and watch out for your knees.\n\nBy car\nBangkok is notorious for its massive traffic jams, and rightly so. In addition, traffic is chaotic and motorcyclists seemingly suicidal. Therefore, most tourists consider driving in Bangkok a nightmare, and it is recommended that you stick to public transport. However, the proliferation of massive shopping malls means that there are now places to park if you must drive into town, albeit at a high cost. Smartphones with GPS and navigation apps with voice directions make it easier to find your way.\n\nBy foot\nMany of Bangkok's main attractions are within  from Siam Square. Walking long distances in hot weather along busy streets can be exhausting, but is a good way to get to see the city up close. Just drink plenty of water and watch out for uneven surfaces and motorcyclists. Food leftovers and the occasional surprises left by stray animals are other reasons to look where you"", ""arly all foreign visitors to Thailand land here at Suvarnabhumi Airport in the far east of the district. Development in eastern Bangkok has been relatively slow, but it is expected that the airport will be the spur for more urban development in the area. Until now, this has at least been true for the hotel business, with many new hotels constructed at Lat Krabang Road trying to make a buck out of transferring passengers.\n\nGet in\n\n\n\n\nBy boat\nBangkok and its traffic-congested commercial districts, including Ramkhamhaeng Road, are hard to navigate by car. Thus, the best way to get into the area is by boat. The Saen Saep Express Boat service runs on the canal of the same name, and you don't have to worry about getting stuck in traffic! The service runs about every 5-10 minutes and as the canal is exactly parallel to Ramkhamhaeng Road with many stops along that road.\n\nIt is a fast and inexpensive way of transport as a single trip costs about 10-20 baht, depending on distance travelled. The most important stops are The Mall Ram (in Hua Mak) and The Mall Bangkapi, both of which are served b"", 'as you can easily waste half a day waiting in traffic just to get to the other side of the city. Three major highways lead to Bangkok from every direction in Thailand. The best way to get to Bangkok from Northern Thailand is via Phahonyothin Road (Rte 1), which comes from Mae Sai near the Myanmar border. Sukhumvit Road (Rte 3) comes from cities in Eastern Thailand, such as Trat, Pattaya, and Chonburi. Phetkasem Road (Rte 4), one of the longest roads in the world, extends all the way to the Malaysian border, serving Southern Thailand.\n\nTo ease congestion on these highways, a new system of motorways has emerged which will be extended in the future. The New Bangkok-Chonburi Motorway (Motorway 7) connects Chonburi and Pattaya. The Kanchanaphisek National Highway (Motorway 9 or ""Outer Ring Road"") makes a giant loop around Bangkok serving most satellite towns around it such as Nonthaburi and Samut Prakan.\n\nGet around\nBangkok has a decent public transportation network by Southeast Asian standards, but much room for improvement lies in its integration.

Bus 58 and Bus 113 from Makkasan Station drive over Phetchaburi Road and then head for Ramkhamhaeng Road.

If you want to buy cheap, there is an interesting street market running kilometres north along Ramkhamhaeng Road from The Mall Ramkhamhaeng 3. Many of the stalls only set up around 18:00, so the area is at its liveliest around 19:00.

Wat Muang Kae is slightly north of Oriental, but is kind of a sleepy pier only served by no-flag lines.\n\nIf you happen to be in Thonburi (the area around Khlong San), you can easily take a ferry across the river. There are ferries from Klongsan to Si Phraya, from Wat Suwan to Oriental and from Sathorn across the river to the pier of the same name. Every 15 minutes a ferry leaves and won't cost you more than a mere 3 baht.\n\nBy bus\nDue to heavy congestion and the complexity of the bus system, getting to Silom by bus can only be advised if you have a lot of time or are on a stringent budget.

* **RER:** The RER has 256 stops in and around Paris, and runs on over 587 km (365 mi) of track. [4]
* **Transilien:** The Transilien network departs from the main train stations (Lyon for line R, Est for line P, Nord for lines H and K, St-Lazare for lines J and L, Montparnasse for line N) and La Defense (line U). [4] 
* **Express Bus:** The Express Bus is inexpensive (50-90 minutes ride) and runs frequently. [5]

When is the best time to visit Paris?,Spring (April–June) and autumn (September–October) have pleasant weather and fewer crowds.

Thanks to the wealth of attractions, a very well-developed accommodation base, a lively nightlife and a robust transportation system, Barcelona has become one of Europe's, and pretty much the world's, most popular tourist destinations.\n\nDistricts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstand\nthumbnail|right|It rarely snows in Barcelona, but when it does it highlights the closeness of the mountain range at one end of the city to the seaside on the other\nWhen to visit\n\nAugust is probably the busiest time for tourists in Barcelona.  However, many shops and restaurants are closed from early-August to early September. During this time, you will find the most expensive hotel rates (outside of conference times such as the Mobile World Congress), and the city is devoid of locals, as the vast majority of residents go on vacation in August and leave the heat and humidity to the hordes of arriving tourists. This is also one of the highest periods of home break-ins, as criminals know that many places are unoccupied for an entire month.\n\nWhile Barcelona has decent, albeit crowded beaches, the locals will be very appre"", ""res of -15degC (5degF) are not uncommon between mid-December and mid-February.\n\nThe spring months (March and April) see variable conditions, with a rapid increase in the average temperature. The weather in late March and April is often very agreeable during the day and fresh at night.\n\nBudapest's long summer - lasting from May until mid-September - is warm or very warm. Budapest has as much summer sunshine as many Mediterranean resorts. Sudden heavy showers also occur, particularly in May and June.\n\nThe autumn (mid-September until late October) is perhaps the best season for tourists as it has little rain and long sunny days with moderate temperatures. At the end of October the weather often turns abruptly colder.\n\nQuality of life\nFor those with a reasonable budget, Budapest offers a rather high quality of life. In terms of culture, cuisine and general 'vibe', Budapest is comparable to other major European cities (see dedicated sections), while prices are lower.\n\nIt's just as well that prices are lower because local pay is significantly lower than in western Europe (for example, a sk"", 'ace and enjoy nature. The spectacle of the grape harvest is worth the detour, as are the walks in the plains and humid valleys. The fog appears and gives off a fascinating atmosphere.\n\nWinter (December 21 to March 21) is cold (around 0 degC) and snowfall is abundant near the Vosges mountains, providing opportunities for skiing. If you are more tempted by long walks, choose the Alsace plain: the snow is less present and the winter atmosphere just as captivating.\n\nSpring (March 21 to June 21) is generally very pleasant, although sometimes some showers and cold winds continue to persist in March. In May the weather is good for sightseeing and walking: the weather is clear, the plains are green and the evenings very mild (14 degC).\n\nIn summer (from June 21st) it is not uncommon for temperatures to reach 30 or 35 degC, the sunshine at this time is comparable to the cities of the south of France. Fortunately, the heights of the Vosges allow you to benefit from a most appreciable freshness and air.\n\nTalk\n\nFrench is the official language and spoken by everyone, young and old.

It is available in 24 hr (), 48 hr () and 72 hr () versions, includes a free guidebook, free use of public transit (metro, bus, tram), and discounts at various shops and restaurants. It may not be worth it to those who already receive discounts (children, students, etc.). The card can be purchased on-line in advance for a discount, at the major tourist offices, and in some museums.

However, to maximise the effect, make your first trip to Angkor Wat in optimal lighting conditions, usually around 13:00-14:00. Sunrise at Angkor Wat is an also great sight to witness, so most of the tourists tend to see the sunrise at Angkor Wat, then explore other ruins in the morning and return to Angkor Wat later in the afternoon. The sun rises behind Angkor Wat and the best colors are seen just before the sun climbs into view. As the position of the sun as it rises varies according to the time of year, position yourself accordingly. For example, in November-December when you are facing Angkor Wat, the sun rises on your right hand side. Grab a place to the extreme left of the entry tower to see the sunrise.

Do I need a car to explore Los Angeles?,"While public buses and metro lines exist, Los Angeles is best explored by car due to its vast layout. Visitors often rent vehicles for convenience and flexibility.","The answer is no, you do not need a car to explore Los Angeles. [1] [2] [4]

Barcelona is plagued with the same problems that plague other major European cities; massive traffic jams and extremely narrow streets in some areas, coupled with a very complicated road system. As such, driving yourself around is not recommended for tourists, especially those with no driving experience in large cities. Public transport will get you to all the major areas, and you should use that as your main mode of transport.\n\nHaving a driving map is essential - plan your route before you set off.

Are there any safety tips for tourists in Los Angeles?,"LA is generally safe, but avoid isolated areas at night and keep valuables out of sight in parked cars.

However, often they have promotions with lower call/SMS rates to the chosen countries - just ask the dealer about that.\n\nStay healthy\nAngeles City has a high rate of STD & HIV cases.\n\nCope\n\n\nStay safe\n\nThe tourist and entertainment areas are generally safe as it is filled with pedestrians and police around-the-clock.  If you\'re male, you will likely get heavily solicited by street vendors pitching cigarettes and trike rides.  However, they are usually nothing more than minor nuisances.  They aren\'t persistent as long as you show disinterest.  It\'s the same with the begging population, which is small but visible.\n\nHowever, venturing into the Clark Perimeter bar areas (around the ABC Hotel) after dark is not recommended or along Santos Street south of Wild Orchid Resort.  The rule of thumb is, if it\'s not well-lit and populated at night, don\'t go there.\n\nFurthermore, be extremely vigilant of street strangers pretending to know you.  These scammers, often middle-aged male trike drivers, usually target solo tourists.  With an extended hand, they would say something like ""Hi, my ', ""ies. Its once high murder rate has dropped to exceedingly low levels. Bombings and kidnappings are a thing of the past, and should not be a concern to visitors at all.\n\nThe principal safety concerns for travelers are pickpockets and the occasional taxi crime. Occasional pickpocketing is still present in the city. Mugging rates have gone down by tremendous levels, due to recent governments' new policies, but while they are not frequent they still occur occasionally. In the eventuality that they do happen (not very common) muggers are usually armed with knives or guns, and you should simply give them what they ask for without a fight--it's never anything worth risking your personal safety for. Most districts and neighborhoods that are frequented by travelers have no problems like this whatsoever. But there are certain areas in neighborhoods, that have a certain problem with pickpocketers and the occasional mugging, these include  some areas of La Candelaria (after dark on weeknights--daytime walks and F-Sa nights are perfectly fine, no matter where you are), some very small parts of Sa"", '. However, paying attention to your stuff, will mostly prevent this from happening. Never hang your purse or bag from the back of your chair in a cafe or restaurant--stealthy theft from such bags is common. Keep your purse or backpack on the floor between your legs while you eat. Petty theft is common but seldom, like in a few other European cities like Paris or Naples. Violent robberies are uncommon, and mostly only happen where you would expect them, at night in a lone street in the wrong quarter. In the unlikely event that you are confronted by a mugger, simply hand over your valuables; they are replaceable and the muggers may be on drugs, drunk, have a knife or a gun.\n\nPopular demonstrations are very common in Buenos Aires, and are best avoided by tourists as these demonstrations sometimes grow into violent confrontations with the police or National Gendarmerie, particularly as they approach the government buildings in the city center.\n\nSince 2005 the government has cracked down on illegal taxis very successfully. Petty crime continues (like taking indirect routes or, less common', "") However, the flipside of that is once you leave the city center, you're mostly on your own, so it's inadvisable under those circumstances to engage in risky behavior such as displaying valuables conspicuously. If you plan to visit sites outside the center of town like the volcanoes, make sure you go with an officer of the tourist police who accompany tourists there at least once a day.\n\nArmed robbery is depressingly common. If this happens to you, rule number one is don't try to resist, as criminals will not hesitate to use their weapons on uncooperative victims. However, there are still ways to minimize the impact of a robbery on your trip. Firstly, it's a good idea to leave your passport in your hotel safe or local home and to carry a photocopy instead. If you are robbed, you will not need to go the consulate for paperwork. Secondly, it's also smart -- especially for those who'll be moving around frequently -- to keep the bulk of your valuables in a money belt strapped to your waist, and place a few dollars in a separate wallet that you can hand over to a robber if you come acros"", ""le in public places and on transport.\n\nStay safe\n\nPickpockets\n\nPickpocketing is the most pressing issue for visitors to Barcelona. Never keep your wallet, cash or important documents in trouser pockets or in bag pockets: a money belt is an easy and inexpensive way to prevent being robbed. You will almost certainly be scoped out several times during your trip if you're in a tourist area or clearly don't fit in as a local, and it only takes a single momentary slip-up to lose your possessions. As always, be alert in crowded places, such as public transport, train and bus stations, La Rambla and Raval. If you are in a crowd, beware of anyone suspiciously or with no intention deliberately coming close to you.\n\nPickpockets usually work with more than one people, with one person using all kinds of tricks to distract you as their accomplices take action. The following are a few common methods:\n At certain tourist hotspots, there are people who will try to show you a 'magic trick'. This involves tying a piece of string around your finger.
