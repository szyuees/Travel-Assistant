In the eventuality that they do happen (not very common) muggers are usually armed with knives or guns, and you should simply give them what they ask for without a fight--it's never anything worth risking your personal safety for. Most districts and neighborhoods that are frequented by travelers have no problems like this whatsoever.

Petty theft is common but seldom, like in a few other European cities like Paris or Naples. Violent robberies are uncommon, and mostly only happen where you would expect them, at night in a lone street in the wrong quarter. In the unlikely event that you are confronted by a mugger, simply hand over your valuables; they are replaceable and the muggers may be on drugs, drunk, have a knife or a gun.\n\nPopular demonstrations are very common in Buenos Aires, and are best avoided by tourists as these demonstrations sometimes grow into violent confrontations with the police or National Gendarmerie, particularly as they approach the government buildings in the city center.\n\nSince 2005 the government has cracked down on illegal taxis very successfully.
