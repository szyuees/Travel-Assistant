Security limits for liquids, gels and pastes


IATA guidelines apply the 3-1-1 limits (in metric equivalents) to all international flights.  They impose 100ml or 3.4oz limits on all liquids, gels and pastes in carry-on baggage.  This includes aerosols, toothpaste, deodorant/antiperspirant sticks, all drinks (including water), etc. that you try to carry through the personal security check.
 All containers for those liquids must fit in a single clear bag/pouch smaller than 20cm x 20cm or 1 quart.  Each container inside must meet the 100ml/3.4oz limit (e.g., a 250ml toothpaste tube with only a small amount of toothpaste left is not allowed). If you want to fill your personal bag to the max, freezer bags are more sturdy than basic quart ""zip locks"".

These restrictions are usually enforced at terminal security checks.  Some exceptions are possible, e.g., for medical necessities or baby care items.  Sanitizing wipes individually sealed in packets are allowed and highly useful in-flight.
nt onboard tends to be more serious if it happens in the air, where it can't be dealt with like on the ground - therefore some things that can be brought onboard other types of transportation are banned on airplanes and luggage is screened upon departure.

Therefore there are many things to take into consideration when packing for a flight - what you can take, where to put it, and what's useful to bring for the flight itself. This article will deal with these topics.

Prepare


As you choose any case or bag for travel (at home or purchase), mind its empty weight, dimensions, ease to carry and apparent durability, e.g., well-made rollers and comfortable handle.

Traditionally any airline ticket included one large suitcase to check in, a small one to place in the overhead bin and one additional item, such as a purse (handbag). Nowadays you may save money by packing less, making ""carry-on only travel"" (see below) a popular option for shorter stays. Don't count on budget airlines being cheap without checking what luggage fees they have.

Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal is located south of Changi Airport. Alight at Tanah Merah MRT station and proceed to Exit B. From there, take bus 35/35M to the ferry terminal. Alternatively, alight at Bedok MRT station and proceed to the adjacent Bedok Bus Interchange, where the two bus services originate from. If you are arriving at Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal, getting a taxi can be very difficult due to the remote location and 200 other people hailing them simultaneously; it's often faster to take bus 35/M a few stops to the nearest MRT station and try your luck there. If you are arriving on a weekday and hence taking the 35, check the destination carefully. The bus calls twice in its route at the ferry terminal and

You will most likely be dropped off at an intersection close to the airport from where it is a 10-minute walk to the terminal building. It is not known how it works the other way round but there seems to be a tourist shuttle bus during the day until 16:30.

If you are approached by a stranger trying to get you to enter a strip club (sometimes presenting it as a cabaret or whiskey bar), refuse.

, but Seoul as the capital city of South Korea has a history dating back to the 14th century. Originally named Hanseong (hanseong; Han Cheng ), the city was the capital of the Joseon Dynasty from 1392 to 1910. The Joseon Dynasty built most of Seoul's most recognisable landmarks, including the Five Grand Palaces and Namdaemun. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the city was renamed to its current name, Seoul. Since the establishment of the Republic of Korea in 1948, Seoul has been the capital of South Korea. Occupied twice during the Korean War by Communist forces from the North, the city was extensively rebuilt and today is one of Asia's primary metropolises. Much of Seoul's infrastructure and facilities, such as the buildings, stadiums and transport systems, are exceptionally modern and clean.

When traveling into Seoul with a lot of luggage or heading to southern parts of Seoul (e.g. Gangnam) then the airport buses are a very good option.  Limousine buses (W15,000 to/from city for one way, W6,500 to/from Gimpo Airport (domestic flight)) travel directly to major areas and big hotels in Seoul, while public buses (W8,000-9.000) will take you to major transit hubs.  If you're visiting for the first time, it's worth paying a bit extra for the limousine bus. For either bus type, consult the big maps or staff to figure out which route best suits your needs; you can then find the shuttles outside 1st floor arrivals (if possible get this information from your hotel before arriving).

Morning

The first attraction is the most important: the gigantic Grand Palace. It is near the Chao Phraya Express Boat's Chang Pier stop.

If your accommodation is in Sukhumvit or Silom, take the BTS Skytrain to Saphan Taksin. The Taksin Pier is just below the Skytrain station. The boat trip to Chang Pier will take around 30 minutes

If you're heading from around Khao San Road, you can just walk to Phra Athit Pier (N13). Head through Soi Rambuttri, then take a right through Soi Chana Songkram. From there, a nearby little alley leads to the pier. The trip to Chang Pier will take about 10 minutes. Alternatively, if you have a lot of energy, the Grand Palace is around 35 minutes' walk from the Khao San Road area.

From Chang Pier, walk straight onto Na Phra Lan Road, and you will see the white Grand Palace fortress walls. It's not easy to find your way in, but just keep on walking till you see the gigantic Ministry of Defense. Check out the City Pillar Shrine (Lak Muang) first and then head your 
lways ask to see a room first, and don't be afraid to test the fan or the air-conditioning if you think you will need it. Some Khao San Road guest houses do not accept Thai guests, or any extra guests at all in some cases.

Budget


Most backpackers head straight for Khao San Road as it has the cheapest accommodation in all of Bangkok. Don't have high hopes on luxury if you're staying here. Most of these places are dark, dingy, unclean and if you're unlucky, you might have to spend the night with bedbugs. Any lodging on Khao San Road will be loud, and anything with exterior windows will get hot.

Try walking a block or two off Khao San proper to find something a little quieter. Soi Rambuttri, the small street past the police station, has reasonable guest houses, though can still be loud in the evenings. The street gets darker and quieter as it wraps around the temple grounds of Wat Chana Songkhram, where you can find some quiet guest houses. Samsen Road and the surrounding area is another escape from the noise and chaos with cheap guest houses at a further distance of the action.





By train: From Bangkok airport go by m taxi to the main Hualamphong train station in town (about 200 baht). Travel by overnight train to Chumphon. Bed in air conditioned cabin for under 1,000 baht. From Chumphon take a high speed ferry to Ko Tao. About 500 baht per person and takes about 1 1/2 hr.

This will be an overnight bus ride to Chumphon, then by ferry the rest of the way and should cost less than 1,000 baht total.

Ko Pha Ngan is the ideal departure point for sites in the Angthong Marine National Park, Southwest Pinnacles, and Sailrock. As they are nearby, divers benefit from shorter journey times and being first to arrive at the sites. It also exclusively opens up night dive opportunities at Sailrock.

In advance or at point of entry?


Many popular travel destinations provide visitors for tourism with a free short-term visa on arrival stamped into their passport. Others will accept payment and issue a visa on arrival for a fee. Still, others require an application and visa to be in your passport in advance, and prior to boarding any flight.

If visas are issued upon entry, this might be at only some points of entry. For example, in developing countries, major airports might issue visas on arrival, but some land borders may require a visa issued in advance or vice versa.

Some countries, particularly those that want to attract tourists, offer an e-visa system. An Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA or ""e-visa"") is obtained online and often has a fee. This is much easier than mailing forms, passports, and payment, but usually falls short of the free short-term visa on arrival. Many countries use the e-visa method: Australia, Canada, India, Kenya, Myanmar, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Turkey, and the United States for example. Not everyone needs an

You cannot do anything which resembles productive ""work"" that could just as easily be performed by U.S. citizens, such as volunteering, rideshare driving, or household chores in exchange for room and board.  If you do not have sufficient savings to cover the entire expected cost of your stay, do not attempt to enter under this program.  ""Business"" in this context is best understood as international trade: negotiating deals with American businesses as an employee or authorized representative of an existing foreign business.  You cannot come to the U.S. for formal education, to get a job, conduct journalism, deliver lectures, or create art under this program.

By foot

Walking in Paris is one of the great pleasures of visiting the City of Light. It is possible to cross the entire city in only a few hours, but only if you can somehow keep yourself from stopping at numerous cafes and shops. In fact within a few years walking combined with biking and the Metro may be the only way to get around the very centre of Paris as plans develop to reduce access to cars in the city centre.

The smartest travellers take advantage of the walk-ability of this city, and stay above ground as much as possible. A metro ride of less than 2 stops is probably best avoided since walking will take about the same amount of time and you'll be able to see more of the city. That said, pay attention to the Metro stations that you may pass by on your journey; the Metro network is very dense within the city and the lines are virtually always located directly underneath major boulevards, so if you become lost it is easy to regain your bearings by 


There are a few TGV high-speed trains directly from the center of Dijon to Paris CDG airport. If your arrival is at Paris Gare de Lyon, which there are frequent TGV trains to Dijon, you can either :

 Use Air France buses linking CDG airport to Paris Gare de Lyon for EUR18
 If you are more on the budget, you can look for the RER B suburban train that have stops right into Terminal 1 and Terminal 2, for a total price of EUR10.30. The safest way to reach the RER B line form Paris Gare de Lyon is by using the automatic line 14 of Paris Metro, up to Chatelet-Les Halles station, where you take the change for the RER B.

By bus

Eurolines  connects Dijon to all the major European cities and Mobigo is the regional bus service of the region.

By car

Dijon is well connected to the freeway and highways networks, where you can drive cars. Traffic is restricted in the centre of the city and mostly reserved to pedestrians. So you will probably want to park your car for the duration of your visit in one of the P+R parkings close to the tramway or buses lines and resume with public transportatio
king time while enjoying delicious local or ethnic food. For dinner, stroll the streets at dusk and consider a EUR20-40 prix-fixe menu. This will get you 3 or 4 courses, possibly with wine, and an unhurried, candlelit, magical evening. If you alternate days like this with low-budget, self-guided eating (picnicking, snacking, street food) you will be satisfied without breaking the bank.

If one of the aims of your trip to Paris is to indulge in its fine dining, though, the most cost-effective way to do this is to make the main meal of your day lunch. Virtually all restaurants offer a good prix-fixe deal. By complementing this with a bakery breakfast and a light self-catered dinner, you will be able to experience the best of Parisian food and still stick to a budget.

Self-catering
Budget travellers will be very pleased with the range and quality of products on offer at the open air markets (e.g. the biggest one on Boulevard Richard Lenoir (near the Bastille), Rue Mouffetard, Place Buci, Place de la Madeleine and over the Canal Saint-Martin in the 11th or in any other arrondissement). 

Question: What are the best transport options in Paris?
Answer: Walking and using public transportations (such as the Metro and buses) are good options, as they are available, affordable and convenient. The best way to avoid traffic and get a feel for the city is to use the Metro, as it is very dense and covers most of the city.

In the locals' absence, hordes of foreign tourists throng the country's major attractions and cities, and Paris especially can see room rates skyrocket.

Holidays
It is advisable to plan ahead for your travel arrangements, especially during the French school holidays. The whole country's schools break for the summer on the first Friday of July and return the first Monday of September. This increased demand for travel means busier roads and more expensive plane and train fares. Avoid travelling around these dates if you can.

Budget travellers will be very pleased with the range and quality of products on offer at the open air markets (e.g. the biggest one on Boulevard Richard Lenoir (near the Bastille), Rue Mouffetard, Place Buci, Place de la Madeleine and over the Canal Saint-Martin in the 11th or in any other arrondissement).

By foot

Walking in Paris is one of the great pleasures of visiting the City of Light. It is possible to cross the entire city in only a few hours, but only if you can somehow keep yourself from stopping at numerous cafes and shops. In fact within a few years walking combined with biking and the Metro may be the only way to get around the very centre of Paris as plans develop to reduce access to cars in the city centre.

The smartest travellers take advantage of the walk-ability of this city, and stay above ground as much as possible. A metro ride of less than 2 stops is probably best avoided since walking will take about the same amount of time and you'll be able to see more of the city. That said, pay attention to the Metro stations that you may pass by on your journey; the Metro network is very dense within the city and the lines are virtually always located directly underneath major boulevards, so if you become lost it is easy to regain your bearings by 

Question: When is the best time to visit Paris?
Answer: The best time to visit Paris is to avoid the summer and school holidays, as well as other peak travel seasons like the French public holidays. The summer months (July and August) are the most crowded and expensive, and the school holidays in July and September, as well as the French public holidays, are also peak travel seasons. The best time to visit Paris is during the shoulder season (April to June and September to November), when the weather is pleasant and the crowds are smaller.",0.6539205312728882

Get in
Downtown LA is simultaneously the hub of the freeway network, road network, commuter rail network, subway / light rail network, and bus network in the region, and thus very easily accessible. Parking lots are also plentiful, though rising steadily in price.

By car

Downtown LA can be accessed directly via the Pasadena Freeway (SR-110), the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10), and the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5 and US-101). Just outside Downtown LA, these freeways connect to the Golden State Freeway (I-5), the Hollywood Freeway (US-101), the San Bernardino Freeway (I-10), the Harbor Freeway (I-110), and the Pomona Freeway (SR-60).

Are there any safety tips for tourists in Los Angeles?,"You are a helpful travel assistant. Use the information below to answer clearly and factually.

Stay safe

Scams against tourists are almost a national sport, though they're usually obvious. A good rule of thumb is that if someone approaches you on the street, they're trying to scam you. Don't talk to them. Common scams are:
The place you're going to is closed, why don't you take my tour? (Taxi drivers may use this. You can avoid this by using Uber or Careem.)
 You need help crossing the street? Come, let me help you!
 Let me show you my shop, it's just on this corner. No this corner, no this corner, etc.
 Let me show you how to get to the mosque - no baksheesh, just LE50 to get in and go up to the roof. (Your new friend then tips the mosque guardian LE10 and pockets the rest.)

During politically-calm times, you can walk around the main streets anytime you feel like roaming. It is fairly safe and you will always find lots of people around smiling and offering to help. Women alone can expect to be the target of an excessive amount of catcalling, but it rarely goes beyond that. Around the more touristy locations there is an abundance of 'helpful' people, but be car
ded; they're reasonably safe. Nonetheless, rip currents and jellyfish can challenge even the best swimmer. Pay close attention to lifeguard instructions and warning signs. Never swim outside of marked zones. Wear shoes on the beach to protect your feet from glass and hot sand. When boating, monitor your weather radio frequently. Do not swim or operate a boat when under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

Florida's crime rate is slightly lower than the national average. Local authorities do an excellent job of patrolling the tourist areas. Use the same precautions that you would in any big city. Keep a close eye on your purse or backpack, especially when shopping or visiting attractions. Lock your car and stash valuables out of sight. Avoid walking alone at night in unfamiliar neighborhoods.

Although Florida's roads are frequently upgraded, traffic tends to be quite heavy through tourist areas. Try to avoid driving during morning and evening rush hours. Allow extra time to reach your destination; stay in the right lane except when passing. The roads can be confusing, so use a good GP
of nice and cheap fruit bars.







Sleep







Stay safe

Although crime is rarely violent, beware of pickpockets and don't flash your valuables or wear a bum bag/fanny pack. Street kids, taxi drivers, and others may harass tourists. They will usually desist after a stern ""La!"" or two. Or you can say ""la shukran!"" (no thanks) or ""emshi"" (go!).

Port Said is a conservative city, so women should cover their shoulders, midriffs, cleavage and legs. Even still, women can expect to be heckled or harassed in the street, especially if walking alone. The best response is to ignore the offender and pretend you don't hear anything. Cover your head when entering places of worship.
