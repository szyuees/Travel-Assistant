What is the baggage allowance for Singapore Airlines?,"You are a helpful travel assistant. Use the information below to answer factually and concisely.

Context:
nt onboard tends to be more serious if it happens in the air, where it can't be dealt with like on the ground - therefore some things that can be brought onboard other types of transportation are banned on airplanes and luggage is screened upon departure.

Therefore there are many things to take into consideration when packing for a flight - what you can take, where to put it, and what's useful to bring for the flight itself. This article will deal with these topics.

Prepare


As you choose any case or bag for travel (at home or purchase), mind its empty weight, dimensions, ease to carry and apparent durability, e.g., well-made rollers and comfortable handle.

Traditionally any airline ticket included one large suitcase to check in, a small one to place in the overhead bin and one additional item, such as a purse (handbag). Nowadays you may save money by packing less, making ""carry-on only travel"" (see below) a popular option for shorter stays. Don't count on budget airlines being cheap without checking what luggage fees they have.

Suitcases are usually made to fit the airline allo
rom the bus at various points.
Taxis are available and the ride takes about 30 min. Taxis leaving from the airport operate on a voucher system; buy your voucher from the taxi desk inside the terminal (next to the car rental desks). A trip to the city centre is RM45 for up to 4 passengers.
From/to Singapore:
If you are planning to go to Senai Airport from Singapore, the cheapest option is to travel to JB Sentral (see By bus below) and then transfer to a Causeway Link Airport (CWA) shuttle bus, or to Larkin Sentral terminal by express or non-express bus and transfer to an airport-bound bus. If you're in a hurry, you can take an ordinary Malaysian taxi for an official rate of RM45 from the taxi rank at JB Sentral, after clearing Malaysian immigration and customs. From JB to Senai takes around 30 min off peak. Buy your coupon from the counter before boarding the taxi.

Singapore Changi Airport
Singapore Changi Airport () across the border in Singapore is commonly used by locals due to its better connections. The downside is that you will have to pass through customs and immigration twice
ures from such locales to your country.
 Consider the safety record of the airline, the aircraft it uses, and airport reputations if flying into smaller airfields or developing countries.  Also look for flight segments you've been offered under a code-sharing arrangement, where you book on a reputable airline but actually fly on a different one for any part of your trip.  You may then be flying an airline or aircraft with a poorer or unknown safety record, or that has baggage capacity less than you may need for your trip. Note that airlines from developing countries (such as Air Zimbabwe) can have outstanding safety records, so don't make assumptions. The European Union bans a bunch of airlines from its airspace. The list is a matter of public record, but the reasons are sometimes arguably political. That said, you may want to follow the EU's lead in not using an airline even if the reason is ""political"".

If you have health issues, consult your doctor and ensure the airline knows about any condition that might be problematic for flying well before the start of the trip - even before

It is about 20 minutes by road to the Geelong city centre along the Princes Freeway, with the Avalon City Express providing a shuttle bus service to Geelong and South Geelong railway stations and meets every Jetstar flight.

Geelong is also easily reached from Melbourne Airport (), the state's international airport with services to various destinations across the country and the world. By road, the trip is about 1 hour and 15 minutes to Geelong along the Western Ring Road and then the Princes Freeway. Gull Airport Service operates pre-booked shuttle buses between Melbourne Airport and Geelong's city centre every day. Otherwise, you can also take the SkyBus from the airport to Southern Cross Station then an onward train to Geelong.

By bus

There are long-distance coaches from Kuala Lumpur and many other destinations in Malaysia through the Woodlands Checkpoint and the Second Link at Tuas, and even from as far as Hat Yai in Thailand. Coaches to Singapore take about 3 hours from Malacca, 5 hours from Kuala Lumpur, 10 hours form Penang and 13 hours from Hat Yai.

Is tap water safe to drink in Tokyo?,"You are a helpful travel assistant. Use the information below to answer factually and concisely.

Context:
This article is about water as a consumable. See water sport for activities in bodies of water.

The quality and availability of drinking water vary between countries and regions. As a general rule, clean water is more difficult to get in hot weather, at low-income destinations and outside settlements.

See dehydration for problems when the body becomes short of water.

Understand


Tap water is often provided by the local government and treated to be at least relatively healthy for the local population. This may include filtering and adding chemicals. Tap water sourced from mountain springs may require little treatment and be of exceptionally high quality. However, water quality varies greatly between regions, and there are many countries where tap water, or at least unboiled tap water is dangerous to drink and can make you sick. One basic rule is to look at what the locals do: If they do not drink the tap water or do so only after boiling it, you should not drink water directly from the tap either.

Your body is accustomed to the water from your local environment. If you travel to 
 may also be OK, but unpasteurized dairy products can transmit tuberculosis. Coffee and alcoholic drinks will dehydrate you and make you feel more thirsty. Never drink sea water, even small amounts.

Stay healthy

Remember that polluted water can affect your health even if you don't drink it, if you use the water for such purposes as washing vegetables or brushing your teeth. See Precautions against disease in the Stay healthy article.

There are different ways of purifying water, some more effective against specific threats. In some areas boiling water for a minute is enough, in others, several minutes are needed. Filters vary in effectiveness, and should you have a concern, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.

Boiling the water or using iodine kills organisms but does not make chemically polluted water safe. You are unlikely to suffer in the short term from mildly chemically polluted water, but drinking it over an extended period could be harmful to your long-term health.

 Water. Tap water is usually not safe to drink. Mineral water is available at almost all shops and is the safest option.

 Tender coconut water, (karikku), is available in even the smallest towns. Tender coconut water is extremely popular. This sweet, creamy treat contains an ice-cream like cream which can be drank, housed in a delicious pulp that can be eaten. It's good for you, too.
Coffee (kapi) and tea (chaya): unlike other parts of South India, in Kerala tea is more popular than coffee. It's virtually impossible not to find a stall selling tea. The famous tea of Kerala is the Kannan Devan brand. In Kerala one can find Milma (a milk brand) booths selling tea with milk and snack eateries. Coffee is more popular in urban areas. Popular national brands like Cafe Coffee Day and many local cafes offer various flavours of coffees with western/oriental snacks. Kerala's own traditional cafe is Indian Coffee House, which are old-fashioned pre-1970s styled coffee shops that offer Kerala coffee along with regular Kerala foods. From the new generation of cafe

Question: Is tap water safe to drink in Tokyo?
Answer: No, tap water is not safe to drink in Tokyo. The locals do not drink the tap water in Tokyo, and you should not drink water directly from the tap either. In Tokyo, you may want to consider buying mineral water or tender coconut water. If you prefer to drink coffee or tea, you can find these options at shops and stalls throughout the city.

throughout, including some of the common big chains.

Seoul has plenty of budget places to eat. Everything from convenience store junk food and noodles to street stall food and lots of 24 hr Korean fast food restaurants. The 24-hour restaurants are great because they've usually got a wide variety of foods, including: mandu, odeng, ddeokbokki, naengmyeon, udong and ramyeon. Prices do vary from about W2,000-9,000 at these restaurants. Also open late into the night are Korean BBQ restaurants, which are everywhere in Seoul.  These can be very cheap and are usually of good quality.  Barbecue options usually are limited to pork and beef, and they often come with a smattering of side dishes. Korean BBQ is, in itself, an experience that makes you feel like a Seoulite. The larger department stores in the city have basement food courts that offer excellent food (not recommended if you care about atmosphere).

, but Seoul as the capital city of South Korea has a history dating back to the 14th century. Originally named Hanseong (hanseong; Han Cheng ), the city was the capital of the Joseon Dynasty from 1392 to 1910. The Joseon Dynasty built most of Seoul's most recognisable landmarks, including the Five Grand Palaces and Namdaemun. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the city was renamed to its current name, Seoul. Since the establishment of the Republic of Korea in 1948, Seoul has been the capital of South Korea. Occupied twice during the Korean War by Communist forces from the North, the city was extensively rebuilt and today is one of Asia's primary metropolises. Much of Seoul's infrastructure and facilities, such as the buildings, stadiums and transport systems, are exceptionally modern and clean.

thumbnail|The Airport Limousine Bus can take you to downtown Seoul or Incheon
When traveling into Seoul with a lot of luggage or heading to southern parts of Seoul (e.g. Gangnam) then the airport buses are a very good option.  Limousine buses (W15,000 to/from city for one way, W6,500 to/from Gimpo Airport (domestic flight)) travel directly to major areas and big hotels in Seoul, while public buses (W8,000-9.000) will take you to major transit hubs.  If you're visiting for the first time, it's worth paying a bit extra for the limousine bus. For either bus type, consult the big maps or staff to figure out which route best suits your needs; you can then find the shuttles outside 1st floor arrivals (if possible get this information from your hotel before arriving).  Or simply, walk out and ask the many ticket sellers (they are wearing vests) which bus goes to your hotel because if it's a popular one or in a popular area, they

Many popular travel destinations provide visitors for tourism with a free short-term visa on arrival stamped into their passport. Others will accept payment and issue a visa on arrival for a fee. Still, others require an application and visa to be in your passport in advance, and prior to boarding any flight.

If visas are issued upon entry, this might be at only some points of entry. For example, in developing countries, major airports might issue visas on arrival, but some land borders may require a visa issued in advance or vice versa.

Some countries, particularly those that want to attract tourists, offer an e-visa system. An Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA or ""e-visa"") is obtained online and often has a fee. This is much easier than mailing forms, passports, and payment, but usually falls short of the free short-term visa on arrival. Many countries use the e-visa method: Australia, Canada, India, Kenya, Myanmar, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Turkey, and the United States for example. Not everyone needs an

Walking in Paris is one of the great pleasures of visiting the City of Light. It is possible to cross the entire city in only a few hours, but only if you can somehow keep yourself from stopping at numerous cafes and shops. In fact within a few years walking combined with biking and the Metro may be the only way to get around the very centre of Paris as plans develop to reduce access to cars in the city centre.

The smartest travellers take advantage of the walk-ability of this city, and stay above ground as much as possible. A metro ride of less than 2 stops is probably best avoided since walking will take about the same amount of time and you'll be able to see more of the city. That said, pay attention to the Metro stations that you may pass by on your journey; the Metro network is very dense within the city and the lines are virtually always located directly underneath major boulevards, so if you become lost it is easy to regain your bearings by

By car

Dijon is well connected to the freeway and highways networks, where you can drive cars. Traffic is restricted in the centre of the city and mostly reserved to pedestrians.

If one of the aims of your trip to Paris is to indulge in its fine dining, though, the most cost-effective way to do this is to make the main meal of your day lunch.

 Seattle -- Another city in the U.S. that can be doable without a car, with frequent and often overlapping bus services from downtown to the adjacent neighborhoods. Even if you choose to stay near the airport (14 miles, or 23km, south of downtown) there is frequent light rail service from the airport into downtown that allows visitors to ""commute"" into downtown and its adjacent neighborhoods for a day/evening of sightseeing, shopping, dining, or bar hopping.

Get in
Downtown LA is simultaneously the hub of the freeway network, road network, commuter rail network, subway / light rail network, and bus network in the region, and thus very easily accessible. Parking lots are also plentiful, though rising steadily in price.

By car

Downtown LA can be accessed directly via the Pasadena Freeway (SR-110), the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10), and the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5 and US-101). Just outside Downtown LA, these freeways connect to the Golden State Freeway (I-5), the Hollywood Freeway (US-101), the San Bernardino Freeway (I-10), the Harbor Freeway (I-110), and the Pomona Freeway (SR-60).

Drive your car to a parking lot and go by foot from there. Downtown isn't that big and quite walkable, and there are plenty of Metro

Big Blue Bus primarily serves Santa Monica and UCLA/Westwood (and the major streets between), but also has a network of routes that serves just about every neighborhood in the area, as well as routes that head out to Pacific Palisades, Beverly Hills, Culver City, Venice, and an express route (#10) along I-10 to Downtown L.A. Additionally, the #3 bus reaches the LAX Airport Transit Center, making it a handy way for air travelers to reach the Westside cheaply. The standard fare on all buses (except #10) is $1.25.
Culver City Bus primarily serves Culver City, but also runs buses to UCLA/Westwood (#6), Century City (#3), and LAX (#6), thus also serving as a primary carrier of tourists from LAX to the UCLA area. The base fare is $1.

where most visitors will stay. Street crime and street violence are almost non-existent: people regularly leave belongings unattended in the street without fear of theft. Nevertheless, as in the most cities of its size, in crowded places and transport beware of pickpockets. There are no scams but you may be need to bargain at stores that do not have fixed price tags, though bargaining seems to be uncommon.

The traffic can be quite rough during morning and evening rush hour, so pay close attention when crossing the street, especially in non-designated areas. Most locals obey street signs and there may be fines for jaywalking.

Taxi-related scams
The most dangerous thing you will encounter here are the taxi drivers, ripping off tourists and even locals. They may take detours instead of going directly--have a map or navigation ready and tell them the correct way. Never ever believe a taxi driver who wants to convince you that there is no bus or marshrutka to the destination you are heading to--this is mostly a lie. Any story that will get them to the point where you decide to take a ta

Never swim outside of marked zones. Wear shoes on the beach to protect your feet from glass and hot sand. When boating, monitor your weather radio frequently. Do not swim or operate a boat when under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

Florida's crime rate is slightly lower than the national average. Local authorities do an excellent job of patrolling the tourist areas. Use the same precautions that you would in any big city. Keep a close eye on your purse or backpack, especially when shopping or visiting attractions. Lock your car and stash valuables out of sight. Avoid walking alone at night in unfamiliar neighborhoods.

Although Florida's roads are frequently upgraded, traffic tends to be quite heavy through tourist areas. Try to avoid driving during morning and evening rush hours. Allow extra time to reach your destination; stay in the right lane except when passing. The roads can be confusing, so use a good GP

Stay safe

Scams against tourists are almost a national sport, though they're usually obvious. A good rule of thumb is that if someone approaches you on the street, they're trying to scam you. Don't talk to them. Common scams are:
The place you're going to is closed, why don't you take my tour? (Taxi drivers may use this. You can avoid this by using Uber or Careem.)
 You need help crossing the street? Come, let me help you!
 Let me show you my shop, it's just on this corner. No this corner, no this corner, etc.
 Let me show you how to get to the mosque - no baksheesh, just LE50 to get in and go up to the roof. (Your new friend then tips the mosque guardian LE10 and pockets the rest.)

During politically-calm times, you can walk around the main streets anytime you feel like roaming. It is fairly safe and you will always find lots of people around smiling and offering to help. Women alone can expect to be the target of an excessive amount of catcalling, but it rarely goes beyond that. Around the more touristy locations there is an abundance of 'helpful' people, but be car
