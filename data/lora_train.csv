There is no historical basis for the 0.25 km (0.16 miles) route, which has changed over the centuries. Nevertheless, pilgrims traditionally walk the route, identifying with Jesus' suffering. Along the route are 14 Stations of the Cross, each connected with a particular story or event. ""Guides"" hanging around the beginning of the Via will give you a tour for a small fee, accompanied by informed commentary, but this is not necessarily the best plan. Paying a token amount to get yourself started is not a bad plan, but if you have a guide book you can likely handle it better on your own from there, due to the crowded and winding nature of the Via through the Old City's narrow streets. Not all the guides are as respectful of the religious sites along the Via Dolorosa as they could be, sometimes walking headlong into occupied churches mid-service. First Station - Jesus is condemned to death. The traditional site of the Roman fortress where this took place lies inside a Muslim college. Second Stati"

The water fall is at its peak flow during the monsoon months from June to September and wanes out towards the summers from March to June. The entrance to the waterfall is from Collem through the forest department gate. Ticket sales are stopped at 3PM. History Legend has it that a beautiful princess lived in the forest on the edge of the King's palace grounds. She enjoyed bathing in a lake nearby and ritually drank sweetened milk from a Golden Jug upon finishing with her bath. One day, while enjoying her jug of milk, she found herself being watched by a handsome prince standing among the trees. Red with embarrassment at her inadequate bathing attire, the Princess poured the jug of milk in f"
Describe Phuket.,"Thai Air Asia, Bangkok Airways and Thai VietJet Air. Thai Airways flies from Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport several times every day, and once daily from Chiang Mai (but there are no direct flights in the opposite direction). Additionally, they sell tickets from/to many domestic and international destinations with stopovers in Bangkok, which are usually cheaper (especially international) than if you book separate tickets. Worth checking if you book just a few days before flight, as low-cost airlines may cost just a few less in this situation, but you get world-famous Thai Airways service. Air Asia fly from Phuket to Chiang Mai direct, twice a day at 10:35 and 19:20, affording an opportunity to combine a beach holiday with experiencing the wildlife and exotic cultures of northern Thailand. From Chiang Mai to Phuket flights depart at 13:00 and 21:45. They fly from two cities in Isaan as well, daily from Udon Thani (handy for a trip into Laos) and four times per week from Ubon Ratchathani. Bangkok Airways has a monopoly on direct flights between Phuket and U-Tapao (Pattaya/Sattahip) a"
What is Burundi famous for?,". Work Burundi is not usually considered a top destination for career advancement. Weak infrastructure, political instability, an inefficient bureaucratic system, a lack of transparency, and low salaries do not make the country a highly popular place to work in. Due to a lack of opportunities in Burundi, many Burundians often migrate to other countries. Many NGOs are situated in Burundi. If you have a background in politics or international relations, working in the country won't be such a bad idea. In addition, the country is a great place to further develop your French language skills and deepen your understanding of politics and government. Stay safe Although some semblance of normality has returned to much of the country with the conclusion of the nation's democratic transition and a democratically chosen head of state in 2005, travellers should be warned that there is still significant insecurity throughout the country and exercise extreme caution.

What can I do in Istanbul to New Delhi overland?,"Things to do: summer (May to July). Summers can be really hot in New Delhi, and chilly winters may greet you in December and January. Read The book to read before leaving to go on the road is Danziger's travels: Beyond Forbidden Frontiers. It is the story of a hair-raising 18-month overland trip from London to Beijing in 1984 by Nick Danziger (). Another great read is The Wrong Way Home: London to Sydney the Hard Way by Australian writer Peter Moore (), in which he travels along the ""Hippie Trail"".

What are some attractions in Providence?,"d not be abandoned. The downtown area can be dodgy at night, especially around Kennedy Plaza and Washington Street. The club areas on the outskirts of downtown have also been known to draw some issues, though most are gang related. Another area to avoid at night is the Camp Street area of the East Side. There is some known gang activity and there has been some violent behavior in the past. Also, late nights on Federal Hill are a great place for drunken misbehavior, so exercise caution whilst in the bar and club area of this historic neighborhood. As far as violent crime goes, it is best to avoid South Providence and the Olneyville neighborhoods of the city. There is little reason for most tourists to go to these locations, though the city's three main hospitals are relegated to the South Side. Olneyville's New York System was featured on Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate series, and while there are two other locations within driving distance of Providence (Rhode Island is the smallest state, after all), a quick visit here to get a few hot dogs will not result in a problem un"
What can I do in Buffalo?,"Things to do: ly Feb-Apr, though it varies by year), when the old no-meat-on-Fridays rule still applies. Buffalo also has its own slate of candies, pastry, and sweets of local provenance: Sponge candy, though it's (contrary to local belief) not unique to the Buffalo area, is the best-known of these, and you'll find it at any local candy shop worth its salt. Brown sugar, corn syrup, and baking soda are mixed together into a thick syrup and then baked, releasing bubbles of carbon dioxide gas from the latter which get trapped in the mixture as it hardens and sets into a toffee, creating a crunchy, latticed interior. The whole thing is then covered in chocolate. The Fowler's chain of chocolate shops supposedly sells the best, though its competitors Watson's and Parkside Candy would beg to differ. Ice cream lovers visiting Buffalo should not bother asking about the origins of the Mexican sundae, which are shrouded in obscurity, but should take the opportunity to dig into this salty-sweet favorite of vanilla ice cream topped with hot fudge, whipped cream, and -- this is the key ingredient -- skin-on Spa"

The New Mexico State Capitol Building, also called the Roundhouse for reasons that'll be obvious when you see it, is nearby. You'll dodge seemingly perpetual construction on Cerrillos as you head back for I-25, with a number of older motels along the way. The properties north of St. Michael's are part of Route 66's history, as they are all on the historic road and have been around since its heydey. These include the very nice El Rey, the International Hostel, and other properties of varying quality. See the article on where to sleep in Santa Fe for details. Cerrillos rejoins I-25 at exit 278, but you'll get off the interstate again at exit 276, where Route 66 followed what is now the south frontage road.

What are some attractions in North York Moors?,"ewhere"" as it's a barely perceptible rise above the expanse of soggy heather. This section is called the Cleveland Hills, with the Hambleton Hills on the west flank of the moors. The plateau to the south is dissected by rivers flowing into the Ryedale and Derwent catchment. Slopes and woods: the abrupt edges are too steep for farming, even for sheep or forestry conifers, so they have natural deciduous woodlands of great age, with ancient oaks. On the gentler slopes to the south forestry is possible, such as Dalby Forest, which has mountain bike trails and similar recreations. The lower pastures are dotted with farms, with drystone walls around the fields and bawling sheep.

How can I travel to Tillamook State Forest?,"Tillamook State Forest is a state forest on the Northern Oregon Coast. Understand History The area of the Tillamook State Forest has been a valuable natural resource to the inhabitants of the area for many thousands of years. The wood and bark from the Western red cedars was used for a variety of purposes including shelters and basketmaking. The natives would travel the rivers and trade the resources of the forest with the tribes on the coast, within the valley, and at the Columbia River. The area has been burned by multiple large fires throughout the decades including the infamous Tillamook Burn. These were a series of fires starting in 1933 that burnt vast portions of the forest. It was replanted from the 1940s until the 1970s. Back in the 1800's there were multiple reported fires as well including one that possibly burned most of the Oregon Coast. The area was likely a rich source of furs for the early trappers and Fort Vancouver. Once the abundance of fur bearing animals ceased to exist and the land sharing treaties expired, the focus was then moved to the wood industry. Ra"

Most of those cities are situated at or close to the Baltic Sea, but trade contacts were also established to the North Sea and far inland. Understand The Hanseatic League originated in the High Middle Ages as an association of low German merchants who lived, worked and traded in several cities mostly along the Baltic Coast. By the Late Middle Ages the cities themselves had taken over the administration of the Hanse and it can be said that cities were ""members of the Hanse"" during that time.

Tell me something about Learning languages abroad.,"Learn Foreigners tend to find each other. At universities with many exchange students they may live in the same quarters and have common leisure activities. At workplaces with many foreigners using English for their professional communication and locals speaking a language not known by most of these, it is common for the foreigners not to learn the local language. Make an effort to find local friends, attend language courses as intended, and go out to places where the locals go. At a university, if you are on an exchange student programme with few locals, you may want to also take some courses with mostly locals, to make friends with local students. A language exchange is a great way to meet someone to practice with. There will surely be people in the area who want to practice their English, you just need to find them so you can meet up. A common arrangement is to spend a certain amount of time (say, half an hour) speaking one language, then switch to the other one, so that both people get to practice. Look for language exchanges online, ask around, or if you're studying at a univ"

How can I travel to Novo Hamburgo?,"Novo Hamburgo is a city in Greater Porto Alegre in the Sinos River Valley. Understand The area of Novo Hamburgo was inhabited by indigenous peoples until the mid-18th century, when Portuguese immigrants (largely Azorean) arrived in the region. However, the area prospered with the arrival of immigrants of German origin to the region, who founded a settlement in 1824. The city was named after the German city of Hamburg, and much of the population of Novo Hamburgo is still of German origin. From the 1930s onwards, Novo Hamburgo became known as ""the national footwear capital"" and began to attract several industries in the sector. However, Novo Hamburgo's economy began to face a crisis in the 1990s, fueled by fierce Chinese competition in the international footwear market and economic problems, which led to the closure of several factories and a diversification of its economy.

What can I do in Mexico City?,"Things to do: vorite pastime throughout the country. While similar to professional wrestling elsewhere in that the outcomes are predetermined, it developed quite differently from wrestling in the rest of the world. Wrestlers, known in Mexico as luchadores (female: luchadoras), tend to work much faster than those in the rest of North America, employing complex chains of moves, numerous high-flying maneuvers, and often-realistic submission holds. Also, rings in Mexico often lack the spring supports used in many other countries, which means that wrestlers typically don't take falls landing on their back as they often do elsewhere. More often than not, aerial moves involve wrestlers launching themselves outside of the ring at their opponents, allowing them to break the fall by tumbling. Finally, Mexican wrestling has far more weight classes than in other countries. Another hallmark of lucha libre is the emphasis on tag team matches, which are most often made up of three-wrestler teams instead of the pairs that are common elsewhere. Rules for tag team matches are also significantly different. Perhaps"
Tell me something about Jostedalsbreen.,"aciers are alive and are constantly moving and changing. The extent and visibility of glacier branches change over time and depends on snow cover. For instance, branches that were once impressive and easily visible from the valley may some years later have retracted to the plateau. Understand The main glacier rests on a mountain plateau west of the Jostedalen valley, hence the name. The glacier ice covers a total area of about 500 km2, while the national park is more than 1300 km2. Jostedalsbreen is a temperate glacier such that it is at melting point throughout the year, from its surface to its base. The glacier is not frozen to the bedrock but flows along the slopes and through the valleys like a river, albeit at very low speed from 1 cm/day up to 100 cm/day (3 feet per day). Flow is highest at surface and middle causing the ice to crack and break up. Chunks of ice regularly falls from the edge or front of the glacier, a process known as ice calving. The resulting huge waves in lakes or the chunks of ice themselves are deadly. Glaciers are created by snow accumulated and gradu"

Most travellers cheque issuers have arrangements to replace them around the world in a short time frame so you are not long left without cash.

If you are travelling from Germany to the U.S. and know you are spending $1,100 to stay at your New York hotel that accepts travellers cheques, you can purchase that value (U.S. dollar denomination cheques) in advance with no risk of exchange movements at the time.

Tell me something about Balinese phrasebook.,"Balinese or simply Bali (known natively as Basa Bali) is a language spoken predominantly by the Balinese people, native to the Indonesian island of Bali and its adjacent islands. It is a very tough language for non-Balinese to master, and while related to Javanese, is not mutually intelligible with it. You are unlikely to need to learn Balinese, as virtually every Balinese speaker is also able to speak Indonesian, and many can even manage some English. That being said, attempting to communicate in Balinese would almost certainly please the locals. The language has three main registers depending on the status of those speaking: low (basa ketah) middle (basa madia) high (basa singgih) This phrasebook will cover the low register only as that is the language spoken by the vast majority of Balinese, and the only one likely to be encountered by visitors.

Cognates in English English has borrowed a huge number of French words since the Norman conquest of England in 1066 and also shares a large number of cognates that English borrowed directly from Latin, so you will recognize many French words, especially after you get used to French pronunciation. For example, a large number of words ending in -tion are spelled the same way in French, although the pronunciation is different. Among these words are production, introduction, participation and indication. Also, words ending in -ty in English normally end in -te in French, including personnalite (personality), universite (university), compatibilite (compatibility) and securite (security). Another signpost to look for is that words that end in -ous in English usually end in -eux (masculine singular) or -euse (feminine singular) in French.

Again, the city government's sympathetic assistance proved invaluable: they not only agreed to take ownership of the building and lease it back to the group for no charge, freeing it from the burden of property taxes so that all their funds could go toward preserving the building, but they were also instrumental in setting up a formal eight-person committee of local political figures, businesspeople, and community members that evolved to become the executive board of the King Urban Life Center, a new community organization whose task was to establish a wide gamut of educational programs that would take place there. By another stroke of luck, building inspectors found St. Mary of Sorrows to be in remarkably good condition structurally, which meant that--with the exception of some comparatively minor roof repairs and facade cleaning--the bulk of the funding the King Center had lined up could be used for those programs.

On-skin repellent (only repellents containing ~40% DEET are effective, such as NoBite, or Azeron Before Tropics) is good but should be used in combination with on-clothes repellent (i.e., NoBite). The clothes repellent is odorless approximately an hour after application, and clothes can be washed up to 4 times before it needs to be re-applied. If you wear long-sleeve clothing treated with the repellent and apply on-skin repellent to the skin parts not covered, you will be very safe against mosquito bites and can skip the prophylaxis with its notorious side effects.

Cornwallis and Ellesmere Islands featured in the history of the Cold War in the 1950s. Concerned about the area's strategic geopolitical position, the federal government relocated Inuit from Nunavik (northern Quebec) to Resolute and Grise Fiord. In the unfamiliar and hostile conditions, they faced starvation, but were forced to stay. Discussions on dividing the Northwest Territories along ethnic lines began in the 1950s, in order to give the Inuit people a degree of self-government. In 1982, after much debate and argument, it was decided to divide the Northwest Territories into two parts, one called Nunavut and the other retaining the name ""Northwest Territories"". On April 1, 1999, Nunavut came into existence.

The same concept was used for Marina el-Alamein on the Mediterranean, Taba Heights on the Sinai east coast and Port Ghalib. The construction of El Gouna (the name translates to ""the bay"" or ""the lagoon"") on the site of the village of Kafr el-Guna began in 1989 with work on the Tamr Henna Palace.

Is Greece worth visiting?,"rms and conditions and inspect the cars very carefully and note down the smallest irregularities before signing, as it is in their interest to not fully inform you of hidden damages. By boat The frequency, reliability and availability of Greek ferries are largely dependent upon the time of year. For instance, during the winter off-season (January to March), the weather on the Aegean can be extremely rough and boats are often kept in port for days at a time. This type of delay is extremely unpredictable (it is not a decision of the ferry companies, but rather, that of the port authority) and determining when a boat in harbour will actually set sail is near impossible. Therefore, travellers in off-season should build some flexibility into their schedule and not plan on departing an island in the morning and catching a flight home in the afternoon. On the opposite end of the spectrum, ferries in August fill up due to the National Holiday (15 Aug), so travellers should plan ahead. As for routes, during high-season there are extensive connections from Athens and quite a few in-between"
What can I do in Cottage rentals in Canada?,"Things to do: onal fees and surcharges that are so common in travelling. Usually the only extra fee incurred with renting a cottage is a security deposit, typically around $200-$500, that is returned after checkout if no damage is done to the property. Apart from a security deposit, additional fees are usually only charged if the renter requests additional goods or services such as a fishing boat. How to get there Cottages are often in remote locations. 99% of the time, the only way to get a cottage is by car. Cottages are also far from cities; the vast majority of cottages are at least a 90 minute drive from the city; a drive of six hours or more is not unheard of. Also, cottages can be far from gas stations; ask the owner, and if no gas stations are nearby, bring a gas can. If you are coming from abroad and you don't live near the Canadian border, then the only way to get to a cottage is to get a flight/bus/train to the nearest major city and then rent a car and drive.

It was a small market town until the 19th century, when iron foundries were established powered by locally-mined coal; these were west bank and the town centre migrated there.

What can I do in Shopping in China?,"Things to do: China. In the major cities, some of them can make a fine job of Western-style garments. Shirts, pants and suits can be measured, fitted, assembled and delivered within three days in many cases.

The styles than most Westerners are familiar with are the cheongsam (Chang Shan changshan; cheuhng-saam in Cantonese), also known as the qipao (Qi Pao qipao), though the popular form-fitting version only dates back to Shanghai in the 1920s. The corresponding male dress is known as the tangzhuang (Tang Zhuang tangzhuang) though its modern form also dates back only to the early 20th century.

Meanwhile Hamburg saw itself become a ""free"" city more than in just the name, first adopting Lutheranism during the Reformation and accepting protestant refugees persecuted in their home cities, and later allowing pretty much full religious freedom, becoming home to all kinds of religious minorities, including Sephardic Jews and even Catholics. The citizens (particularly the wealthy merchant elite) pressed against attempts to impose laws on them, and negotiated ""recesses"" from their rulers, which meant that Hamburg was governed by a bicameral parliament with a relatively high degree of democracy and personal freedoms. The last ruler to occupy Hamburg before the Second World War was Napoleon, driven away by the Russians in 1814. Continuing as a sovereign state in its membership of the various forms of German un"

Describe Florida.,"ong time, Florida had been a swing state in presidential elections, almost evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats. However, a large influx of retirees in the 21st century has swung the political balance in favor of the Republicans as of the 2020s.

It is estimated that there were some 350,000 inhabitants, of many tribes, when the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon arrived in 1513 in search of, according to legend, the Fountain of Youth. The first European settlement dates back to the 1560s with St. Augustine, established in 1565, holding the distinction of being the oldest permanent European settlement in what is now the United States. However, this early settlement did not lead to the same level of rapid colonization that took place in the British colonies to the north, as the climate made large-scale settlement, especially inland, difficult for Europeans who were used to milder climates. Attempted settlements by Europeans, such as the"

Understand During the youth of the Rocky Mountains, about 60 million years ago, large number of streams carried eroded soil, rock and other materials eastward from the range. These materials were deposited on the vast lowlands which are today called the Great Plains. Dense vegetation grew in these lowlands, then fell into swamps, and was later buried by new layers of sediments. Millions of years later, this plant material turned into lignite coal. Some of the plant life became petrified, and we can find large amounts of exposed petrified wood in the badlands. While sediments continued to be deposited, more streams cut down through the soft rock layers, carving the variety of mesas, buttes, rock formations, pinnacles, spires and valleys are the features of the badlands seen today. While the badlands terrain may appear to be barren, there is a great variety of wildlife and plant life here. The"

Give me travel tips for Iceland.,"Travel tips: ding to a situation where in 2022, the number of tourists received during the year exceeded four times the local population. A lot of the tourism industry is supported by immigrants. Most immigrants are from Eastern Europe and South East Asia, and they typically speak English and little to no Icelandic. This has created friction amongst Icelanders, who feel like they should be able to go to restaurants (for example) and be able to use Icelandic rather than being forced to speak English. For names, Icelanders use the old Norse patronymic system. This means that Icelanders typically have a last name of <father's name> prefixing ""son"" or ""sen"" if a male, and ""dottir"" if a female. Thus the practice of women, after marriage, taking the last names of their spouse makes no sense in Iceland, and is not followed. A family of four - father, mother, son and daughter - will all have different last names. This is why Icelanders always address each other by their first name no matter how formal the situation. Their phone books are also ordered by first names, followed by the last names, with thei"

The same blurred boundaries between ""generations"" exist with HSPA+ (a faster 3G UMTS branded occasionally as 3.5G or 4G). Modern smartphones entered the market in the latter half of the 3G era. Unless you have a very early-model smartphone (e.g. the first-generation iPhone), there is a very good chance your smartphone is at least 3G-capable. 4G is a faster data connection available in major cities and possibly elsewhere, supported by most modern smartphones. Frequency bands vary by region; some handsets support half a dozen options. As of 2017, all 4G handsets also support 3G standards; most handsets can also fall back to GSM if the network supports it. Old 4G phones do not necessarily support voice over 4G (VoLTE), so they depend on a working 2G or 3G connection for voice calls. However, some providers are phasing out 3G, which means you may have to fall back to 2G or are out of luck. LTE, also known as FD-LTE or LTE-FDD is the main international 4G standard.

Boda-boda accidents account for most of the hospital visits and traffic fatalities in Kampala; you have been warned! Boda-bodas got their name from the bicycle taxis that operated at some of the busy border crossing points. Buses had to discharge their passengers at the exit border control, who then had to walk to the entry border control. The distance across no man's land at some borders can be considerable. Hence the bicycle taxis would cry ""boda-boda"" (a corruption of the English ""border to border"") to the weary travellers. These bicycle taxis can still be found in most smaller Ugandan towns, however, in Kampala they have been replaced by motorcycles. Boda-bodas charge USh 3000-5000 for trips within Kampala (foreigner price; correct at July 2011).

Give me travel tips for Christianity.,"Travel tips: set up ""no trespassing"" signs near your property. Many architecturally interesting churches belong to styles of Christianity that expect people - especially women - to dress conservatively, and men to remove their hats. Often (especially in the heavily visited cases) this will be spelled out in so many words, but exceptions exist, where you might commit a social faux pas or even get thrown out of the church, without even knowing. When in doubt, ask a local before heading out. Although it should be noted that in churches in Western Europe, which serve more as tourist sites and less as places of worship, a dress code is rarely enforced. Women have traditionally been required to cover their hair in church, but this is no longer mandatory in most Protestant (except Anabaptist denominations) and Roman Catholic churches. Veiling for women remains mandatory in most Orthodox, Eastern-rite Catholic and Anabaptist churches, and can be seen in more conservative Roman Catholic congregations as well.

Most countries have some legal protection of archaeological sites. Legal consequences for trespassing in closed areas, damaging remnants, or removing artifacts, are often harsh. In particular, countries with a colonial history may resent loss of relics to places like the British Museum, and may therefore be inclined not to be at all gentle with modern relic exporters.

Describe Urban rail adventures.,"trocable was the first among a number of Latin American cities to introduce cable cars or aerial trams--not as a fun ride for tourists, but as an everyday transport for local commuters--in the 21st century.

It links the mostly poor barrios (i.e. suburbs and informal settlements) on the surrounding mountains with the economic centre down in the valley that is served by the Metro proper (elevated rapid transit). Thus, it has drastically reduced the commuting times of many working-class neighbourhoods.

Describe Belize.,"e adult HIV/AIDS prevalence rate is 2.5% or one in every forty adults, this is notably higher than in most of Europe or Anglo-America and also quite a bit higher than in other parts of Central America like Nicaragua or Costa Rica. Respect Belizeans are some of the most socially relaxed people in the world, especially if you venture inland away from the tourist islands of Ambergris Caye and Caye Caulker. The pace of life is generally slower in Belize, so it's good practice to begin any social interaction, even to ask a quick question, with eye contact and a genuinely pleasant greeting. Most rural Belizeans enjoy casual conversation and you could easily find yourself chatting for a few hours. The Maya communities can be a little more reserved at times. As always, a little respect and politeness will carry you through. Connect Payphones are the most common public phones and accept pre-purchased phone cards. Internet cafes can be found in larger tourist areas, but are infrequent in rural areas. As of Oct 2025, it is increasingly common for cafes and restaurants to offer wifi service"

Tell me something about Rome.,"of early Christian churches, including San Clemente and Santa Costanza, there are churches built over a period of 1700 years or so, including modern churches constructed to serve Rome's new suburbs. Some churches in Rome deny admission to people who are dressed inappropriately. You will find ""fashion police"" at the most visited churches. (""Knees and shoulders"" are the main problem - especially female ones.) Bare shoulders, short skirts, and shorts are officially not allowed, but long shorts and skirts reaching just above the knee should generally be no problem. However, it's always safer to wear longer pants or skirts that go below the knee; St. Peter's in particular is known for rejecting tourists for uncovered knees, shoulders, midriffs, etc. (You also generally won't be told until right before you enter the church, so you will have made the trek to the Vatican and stood in a long security line for nothing.)

Describe Wildfires.,"ch of Australia, Canada, the United States and the countries around the Mediterranean Sea in particular are known for having large wildfires every year that cause major property damage, and often loss of life too. In the Nordic countries wildfires are quite common, but major wildfires are rare. In Southeast Asia, forests fires are often set by local farmers in Sumatra and Kalimantan, Indonesia in order to clear land for farming, resulting in a thick haze that covers much of Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and parts of the Philippines. Wildfires are also possible in regions where they aren't common, during periods of extended drought or extreme heatwaves. In countries where wildfires are common, there is typically an established procedure for communicating the risks. Learn how to check that info before setting out, and how warnings will be given in the regions you intend to travel to. Checking what reliable information channels exist prior to travel is advised.

Tell me something about Wilderness backpacking.,"trousers or gaiters. However, you can often cope with rain even if you don't have those. You should dress in 2-3 layers (even more if it's really cold) which would prevent most of the rain from getting in. Since it's likely that some water will penetrate through the outer layers, you should take them off (despite the cold) whenever there's a break in the rain or if you find good cover, to allow the water to dissipate from the inner layers. On these occasions it's best to also hang the outer layers to dry; if you're on the walk, spread them across the back of your backpack. Also, if you don't have waterproof shoes and trousers, you may find it best to wear three-quarter pants that don't get all the way to your ankles. If the pants are too long, they'd get soaked with water and mud that will hinder your walk and will even wet your socks inside your shoes. Additionally, you should take advantage of every opportunity to dry your cloths, such as at campfires. Just be careful not to put your shoes too close to any source of heat, as rubber melts at surprisingly low temperatures, even if i"

There is no universally agreed point of the year to change from standard to daylight saving time, leaving wild leaps and fluctuations where one country has already changed and the other has not. Sometimes, one subnational jurisdiction (like Saskatchewan or Arizona) politically chooses to not use DST at all; tee off at the 9th hole of the Gateway Cities Golf Course in North Portal, Saskatchewan and the ball rolls into the cup in Portal, North Dakota an hour later.

What are some attractions in Cycling?,"er through the Lo Wu border crossing, and bring your bicyle on the MTR provided the front wheel is removed. Japan Japan can be a good place for cycling. Drivers are more polite than almost anywhere else and cycling is quite common in some cities, like Kyoto. There are many well-known, well-supported bike routes like the island-hopping Shimanami Kaido Bikeway that connects the main island of Honshu to Shikoku. Nearly every large city and many small cities have bike rental options, usually for a single day at a time but longer rental options are sometimes available. In areas with well-known and popular cycling routes, there are certain to be places to rent bicycles, so it is not necessary to bring a bike to Japan unless you are planning more original routes or traveling across country. Singapore Singapore may not be the most bike-friendly place in the world, but things are improving. Dedicated bicycle lanes are rare on public roads, and there is a general lack of consideration for cyclists from motorists.

What are some attractions in Seafood?,"paste. In Cambodian cuisine, a fermented fish paste called prahok is used to flavour many dishes. Fish is also eaten raw. One type of preparation is ceviche, a specialty of Peru, in which raw fish is cured in lime or lemon juice. Others are traditional to Korea (e.g. hoe), and more famously, Japan. Japan is the land of sushi -- preparations, especially raw fish, with vinegared rice -- and sashimi -- pieces of raw fish (and also a wide variety of seafood and, less commonly, land meats) themselves. If you would like to try raw fish, you may be safest doing so in Japan, as it is central to their cuisine and also popular, guaranteeing quick turnover of stock. In any case, Japanese people do not tolerate fish that's too old, so short of catching your own fish or buying fish direct from a fisherman's boat, you probably won't get fresher fish in any other country. Roe or caviar are fish eggs, and when taken from beluga sturgeon and other scarce (and endangered) fishes, are a very expensive delicacy. Fisheries in the Caspian Sea produce much caviar thanks to the large sturgeon population"

People have even been arrested for lodging complaints against the police, so refrain from lodging complaints against deviant police officers. Transportation Sudan is one of four countries worldwide that do not comply with international flight safety protocols. The fleet of the state-owned Sudan Airways is mainly composed of 1950s-era Soviet aircraft. Some planes have no navigation, lighting, or are missing critical pieces of landing gear. Sudan is a very dangerous country for internal air travel. Entering Sudan via personal car is also challenging. Sudan has a highly militarized border with its neighbor Egypt and Westerners run into problems at the border if they wish to cross. Bus travel is also not without its issues. Some buses are better than others - some are excellent, with icy-cold AC and complementary drinks, others may be less salubrious, e.g. sitting in a hot bus (did we mention no A/C?) with jabbering Egyptian tourists for nearly an entire day.

There are seven species, which similarly to the Giant Tortoises are endemic to different islands. Snakes Geckos Sea Turtles Land Mammals All animals that originally arrived in the islands came here either by swimming, flying or floating. Due to the long distance from the continent mammals were unable to make the journey making the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos. Since the arrival of man to the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.

Describe Kauai.,"Kauai is the most northwestern of Hawaii's major islands and is the 4th largest by size and population. Nicknamed the Garden Island, it is covered with lush greenery and tropical plants, watered regularly by abundant rainfall. As the oldest of the islands, it has been changed the most by the forces of erosion, and this has resulted in natural wonders such as Waimea Canyon and the Na Pali Coast. As a consequence of its age, Kauai also has more miles of sandy coastline than the other Hawaiian islands. Understand The major regions of Kauai can be defined by their location on the island relative to the prevailing trade winds. The north and east sides of the island are on the ""windward"" side of the island, where the winds blow onto the shore. These parts of the island tend to get the most rain, and as a result, are the greenest and most tropical parts of the island. The south and west sides of the island are on the ""leeward"" side of the island, which receive less rain since most clouds have already dropped their rain on the windward side of the island.

Understand Bamako has been continuously inhabited by humans since prehistoric times. In 1883 it was conquered by French troops, and in 1908 became the capital of French Sudan. The city has only a few paved main roads (goudrons), the rest of the city's roads are unpaved, and get dusty during the dry season (November to May) and muddy during the rainy season, offering breeding grounds for malaria-carrying mosquitoes. The city can be hard to navigate through due to the lack of road signs, the complicated layout of the streets and the one way system in the city. The roads are very crowded both with motor vehicles and motorcycles who appear to fill every available space possible. Traffic police are particularly vigilant and will sometimes appear to enforce very arbitrary traffic rules. They are usually on motorcycles as well so it is unwise to try and outrun them in your vehicle as they will easily catch up."

Long sleeves and long pants are not 100% necessary but you will not regret wearing them. A flashlight is necessary for the night, as the jungle is pitch-black. A machete most probably will not be required on short/casual trips but is essential for longer expeditions. A lighter and a pocket knife are a good idea. The pocket knife is especially important since it can provide the only defense against the boa and the anaconda (indeed, attacks do occur). A mosquito repellent is most probably a very smart idea. It keeps other bugs away too and it reduces the risk of being infected by a disease-carrying insect. However, the number of mosquitoes in the jungle is not completely overwhelming, so for longer expeditions you may consider getting used to them. Additionally, a good guide can show you some natural repellents available in the jungle. Sun block is needed especially during the dry season. Otherwise, keep your luggage to the minimum.

What is Targovishte famous for?,"fairgrounds on fire. After the liberation, the fair was restored with a royal decree. After the 1940s, like elsewhere in Bulgaria the communist regime tried to develop heavy industry in the city, including a military vehicle repair plant. Industrialization had already put the fair into decline, and under a command economy its trade aspects were deemed unnecessary. Nevertheless, in the late 1980s the local government started attempts to reboot the fair as a minor industrial trade expo, like the better-known one in Plovdiv. After the fall of the regime in the 1990s, most of the city's heavy industry failed to weather the subsequent economic crisis. Today, Targovishte is an industrial town in decline that it vigorously resists: many smaller enterprises have found their niche, and a large glass factory opened in the mid-2000s, but the fair is a shadow of its former self.

Give me travel tips for California.,"Travel tips: MUTCD is intended to remediate this problem (as seen in California and several other states) by mandating the use of detailed arrows on direction signs that clearly show which lanes split into new lanes at upcoming interchanges, but California has not yet implemented the new MUTCD standard. Thus, one should approach major freeway interchanges in California with caution. Mile-based exit numbering is in progress but is still very erratic in areas; an exit number may not be marked at all, may be marked on the last directional sign before the exit, or may be marked on the final ""EXIT"" sign where the exit ramp separates. Ramp meters In urban areas, the access ramps to a freeway may have traffic lights for each lane (called ramp meters or ramp metering lights; you'll see warning signs that read ""METER ON""). During high-traffic times, the traffic light spaces out the vehicles attempting to merge onto the freeway. Be sure to read the sign below the light as ramps can allow 1 to 3 vehicles per green light. Most ramp meters are for ramps from local roads to a freeway, but some freeway ju"

What are some attractions in Guernsey?,"ersey, is therefore a ""Crown Dependency"". They are not subject to the UK parliament or legislation or - crucially - taxation in any way, and were never part of the EU, but they cede control of defence and most international affairs to the UK. The rules of this arrangement are unwritten and all parties have shied away from testing them. Although Guernsey and Jersey share many similarities, they are as constitutionally separate from each other as they are from mainland Britain, and there is no political entity called the ""Channel Islands"". Guernsey grew up as a fishing port but from 1700 found that smuggling paid better, as mainland taxes rose sharply. Even more lucrative was piracy (illegal) and privateering (much the same thing, but legal if it was against the King's enemies). The islands were occasionally fought over (for instance during the English Civil Wars), but more often they were heavily fortified against invasions that never came. One such phase was during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, another was during the German occupation of the Second World War. So as t"

How can I travel to Oia (Greece)?,"of modern Oia. The Ottoman Empire took over control in 1579, and the name Apanomeria found general acceptance until it was changed to present day Oia in the mid 19th century. At the end of the 19th century, peace brought prosperity. Oia's harbour, Amoudi Bay, developed as an important centre for maritime trade, a position boosted by the declining importance of Venice as a Mediterranean trading hub. It was part of many trading routes, from Alexandria to as far as Russia. By the turn of the 19th century, the fleet consisted of 130 sailing ships and a wharf was set up in Amoudi Bay. Agriculture on Santorini produced wines of excellent quality which were exported to mainland Europe. The economic boom came to an end with the arrival of steam power, which made sailing ships redundant. Oia lost trade to Piraeus and Laurium, and the resulting exodus led to a decline in population which in turn hurt the agricultural sector. A shift to finishing industry brought relief, but by the early 20th century this also started to decline due to overfishing. The World Wars brought economic depression"

Give me travel tips for Switzerland.,"Travel tips: ious about traffic violations. Jaywalking or crossing a red pedestrian light, for example, will be fined on the spot. The upside to stringent traffic rules is that car drivers are generally very well-disciplined, readily stopping for pedestrians at crossings. Football games are the only notable exception: due to the potential threat of hooligan violence, football games (especially in Basel or Zurich) are generally followed by a large contingent of police officers with riot gear, rubber bullets and tear gas. Do not attempt to bribe a Swiss police officer; bribery is an extremely serious offence that will land you in prison. Switzerland has a zero-tolerance policy towards corruption. Switzerland has very strong Good Samaritan laws, making it a civic duty to help someone in need, although without unduly endangering oneself. People are therefore very willing and ready to help you if you appear to be in an emergency situation. The same applies to you if you witness anyone in danger.

It's a Stromboli-type volcano, erupting continuously but without great violence, so it can be approached closely for study and for climbing. The usual climbing routes are from Lake Wilson on its western flank. It was discovered in 1841 by Ross (who gives his name to the Ross Sea), who named it and nearby Mount Terror after his two expedition ships HMS Erebus and HMS Terror. These ships were built as bombardiers, designed to fire mortars, so the names were apt. (The ships were later lost in Franklin's disastrous 1845 expedition to find the Arctic Northwest passage; their wrecks were only found in 2014 and 2016.) The summit crater of Erebus is a lava lake, fed from below by a magma chamber. Steam from side fumaroles freezes to create ice chimneys where microbial life is self-sustaining, with no sunlight or external organic input, so they may model life-processes on the early Earth or on other planets.

In more southerly continental areas very cold subarctic climates can be found, due to July being slightly milder than the required 10 degC (50 degF). Tourist information Destination Nunavut website Talk right|thumb|Iqaluit stop sign Around 65% of people living in Nunavut speak Inuktitut as a first language, and the language is co-official with English and French in the territory. Inuktitut is the traditional language spoken by the Inuit people, and is very closely related to Greenlandic. It is a somewhat hard language to learn for the English speaker, and most English speaking people won't even be able to read it because it is written in its own unique script. Though most Inuit will probably speak English, it would be a good idea to learn a few key phrases or bring an Inuktitut phrasebook along. Learning the script in any case is relatively easy to do. French may sometimes also be useful, though most of the time, not necess"
What are some attractions in Rajasthan?,"g a hefty commission parted by the shopkeeper to the guide/auto driver). The guide is more keen to show you all these shops rather than the places you have travelled to see. Bargain is the key word. If you are buying jewellery, artefacts, handicrafts, etc. definitely bargain. Most tourist shops will bargain up to 30-50%, although some shops, mostly big ones such as National Handloom, India Rugs Exports, Jaipur Rugs, India Crafts, Government organizations, have fixed rates with little or no scope discount on bulk buying.

Describe Longzhou.,"Longzhou (Long Zhou ; Longzhou) is a rural town in Central Guangxi. Understand Longzhou is southwest of Nanning, near the border of Vietnam. Longzhou has quite a history despite its current lack of importance. There is a saying in Longzhou, ""We have an embassy, but no ambassador. A train station, but no trains. And an airport with no planes."" During the late 1800s as French influence grew in Vietnam they tried to expand into Guangxi province. In Longzhou they set up the first Embassy in Guangxi. Wars were fought along the little great wall to prevent further influence. In the early 1900s the Guomindang (Chinese Nationalists) built up their influence in this important river port, they even built an airport to help them keep control of the city. In the 1950s and 60s Ho Chi Minh had a small house in Longzhou where he would be able to meet with Chinese leaders. In 1979 Deng Xiaoping tried to launch a Communist rebellion from Longzhou.

What can I do in Rio San Juan Region?,"Things to do: every year. Eat As most of this region is close to lake Cocibolca and numerous rivers, fresh, high-quality fish can be had for roughly the same prices as comparable meat dishes almost everywhere. A particular specialty in this area are the so-called giant river shrimp, or ""camarones del rio"". These resemble large crayfish or small lobsters, and are quite delicious. Typically you'll pay thirteen dollars for a plate of three. However they are not around year round, as it is illegal to catch them from February to April. Drink As this area is not as developed as the Pacific side of the country, caution regarding tap water is recommended. In most places, running water is only available during certain hours of the day. However, all but the most basic hotels should have a tank that enables you to shower at any time.

Arterial roads follow the grid fairly well (although not perfectly), but side streets frequently disappear for blocks at a time and then reappear. Most of the ""Avenues"" are numbered and they always use East or West to designate whether it is on the east side or the west side of Ontario Street. Some of the major avenues use names rather than numbers (Broadway would be 9th Ave, King Edward Ave would be 25th Ave).

Classes include topics such as painting, photography, wildlife, wildflowers, and geology. Photography The odd shapes of the Joshua tree as well as the dramatic geology and desert scenery make the park a great place for photographers. As with many areas, photography is best in the early morning and late evening hours. For astrophotography, the east side of the park offers the darkest skies but lacks the background of the Joshua tree due to its lower elevation. Lost Horse Valley (enroute to Keys Views) offers an abundance of Joshua trees and rock outcroppings for scene composition, but with light pollution from the Palm Springs and Twentynine Palms areas.

During this period, the nation suffered Mongol invasions, which led to unrest and the eventual establishment of the Joseon Dynasty in 1392. Joseon Dynasty The Joseon Dynasty was one of the longest-running dynasties in the world (512 years), ruling from 1392 until 1910. King Sejong the Great's rule was especially celebrated, as he helped create the Korean script, choson'gul, which allowed even the commoners to become literate. He also expanded the nation's military power to drive out Japanese pirates and northern nomads and regain territories that had been lost. The Japanese invaded Korea under the leadership of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, though the Joseon Dynasty managed to drive them out with the support of China's Ming Dynasty, albeit with heavy losses in the Korean peninsula. In spite of its losses, the nation experienced about 200 years of peace, and its isolationist policies allowed it to further deve"
Describe Warsaw/Old and New Town.,"The Old Town (Stare Miasto) and New Town (Nowe Miasto) are the two oldest parts of Warsaw. Administratively, they are neighbourhoods in the district of Srodmiescie. The Old Town is comparatively small to the old towns of many other European cities, as during the time of its development Warsaw was a small town of mostly local importance and not yet the capital of Poland. The New Town is called so because it was the first part of Warsaw to be built outside of the original city wall ring, but it is indeed not much newer than the old town and much older than most of other neighbourhoods of Warsaw. Both the Old and New Town were almost completely destroyed during the Second World War, and were reconstructed after the war. While, due to the meticulous and painstaking efforts, the impression one gets is that of authentic historic places, it is a 20th-century reinterpretation of the history of this area, and is actually a mixture of buildings that existed in different periods, and in many cases a rather creative faux.

Is Animal ethics worth visiting?,"agents no longer provide events with elephants. Consider visiting an animal sanctuary or a national park to see elephants instead. Horse riding and horse cart rides are offered around the world, often in old towns. Horses need expert handling to keep healthy in cities, coping with noises, pollution, hard surfaces and risks for collisions. Cities usually have more practical modes of transport; the countryside gives a better experience of riding and drawing, both for horses and people. In many countries, the majority of farm animals are treated very poorly; do your research if this concerns you. If you choose to avoid some or all animal products on your trip, see Travel as a vegetarian for advice. Some zoos have a donation service for conservation of the hosted species. Wildlife Observing wildlife in the wild is less intrusive than holding animals captive as entertainment, but there are still concerns.

The site continued in use through the Bronze and Iron Ages and Roman and early Christian periods, but probably only sporadically as traces of those times are few. Later uses were unkind to the place: in the 13th century the monks of Mellifont used the main tomb passage as a grain-storage barn, hence ""New Grange"". The Victorians removed stone to build a decorative folly, and the final indignity was a tearoom perched on top of Dowth. The park is now in the care of the Heritage Ireland branch of the Office of Public Works. Much of what you see represents reconstruction in the 1970s, which has its critics: Newgrange has been described as a ""cream cheese cake with dried currants distributed about"" and ""kind of like Stalin does the Stone Age.""

Sometimes it might be possible to make a shelter of whatever material you will find at the destination, but do not count on that. You need to protect yourself at least from rain and cold. thumbnail|Around the campfire in the Sahara If you are going to a cold destination which lacks combustible material, you may have to bring your own fuel to keep yourself warm. This is obvious if you're going somewhere with ice and snow, but remember that deserts also get notoriously cold during the night. It cannot be stressed enough that you should be very careful when handling fire - you do not want to harm yourself, destroy your equipment or start a forest or bush fire. A further threat in deserts is - as paradoxical as it may sound - drowning. Most of the time people travel in wadis, dried-up rivers, as they provide protection from direct sunlight during the day. Oftentimes you will be inclined to sleep there as well, as they can have rather steep grades at the side"
Is Namche Bazaar worth visiting?,"e 1960s and 1970s this turned into a torrent, and being located at a confluence of trekking trails, Namche was best served to meet their needs.

Tobacco has also spread widely from its origins in the Americas. Tea was introduced into Europe from China during the Age of Discovery, with Russia being the main player in the overland caravan routes via Siberia and Central Asia, while Portugal and the Netherlands initially dominated the sea routes though later the British took over much of the trade. The United Kingdom in particular took a liking to this new beverage, and tea drinking became a status symbol among the British nobility, thus giving rise to the traditional afternoon tea.

The lake's altitude of about 1,100 meters above sea level makes the climate somewhat more temperate than in lower tropical regions, such as Mombasa. There are two main rainy seasons, which vary depending on the region: from March to May and from October to December. These rainy seasons bring frequent, but usually short and intense rain showers. The months of June to September and January to February are drier periods, although the lake and surrounding wetlands continue to maintain high humidity. The lake's proximity also influences the region through local weather phenomena, including sudden storms that can occur on the water. Overall, the climate provides lush vegetation and stable agriculture in the area, but also makes insect protection measures necessary due to the high humidity.

Eat You'll want ""light"" meals, not in the sense of fat or calorie content, but in terms of how much the food weighs in your pack. In fact, you may want to lay off a lot of your ""healthy diet"" habits for the duration of your trip, because you'll want those extra calories, and fats are a good compact source of all-day energy. Wilderness camping is the very kind of lifestyle that led homo sapiens to develop a fondness for that kind of food. Depending on the length of your trip, food could make up a substantial fraction of your pack weight (figure at least a pound or half a kilogram per day).

Although Banda Aceh is nowadays safer than most European cities it is still best to not go out alone after 22:00. Because Sharia law is enforced, drinking alcohol is not permitted, although it is still possible.

These then popped up all over UK but very noticeably in Scotland.

So you may well encounter ""craft"" or ""boutique"" gin from one of these new distilleries. Sleep All short-term accommodation in Scotland must be registered, otherwise it's illegal and probably a flea-pit or fire-trap. This applies throughout Scotland but is especially pertinent to Edinburgh, where demand far exceeds supply and encourages exploitive providers. The law (which does not apply to England) was introduced in 2022 but there is considerable wriggle room until July 2024, so for the time being proprietors can reasonably say that their registration is still being processed. Be increasingly sceptical as the deadline approaches. It's a bit of unwelcome extra bureaucracy for B&Bs, campsites and so on but in the long-term should better protect travellers and honest pro"

What is Japan famous for?,"their mouth with their hand when laughing, smiling, or sometimes eating. Don't feel obligated to do so yourself, although doing this in a formal setting (whether you're male or female) would probably make you seem sophisticated and polite. Saving face is a very important concept in Japanese culture. Particularly in business settings, Japanese people will rarely say ""no"" if they are not interested in a deal, and would instead say something more indirect such as ""I'll think about it"" or ""maybe"" instead. Body language is also used for this in place of words; if your question is met by someone loudly breathing in through their teeth, sometimes accompanied by scratching the back of the head (a gesture that conveys embarrassment), the answer is actually ""no"". Unless it is by a boss or someone from a position of seniority, mistakes are typically not pointed out, and doing so will likely cause major embarrassment. Frankness is not appreciated in Japanese culture; Japanese people are remarkably sensitive to critical comments and they generally believe that being overly critical is disrupti"

How can I travel to Canada?,"ica, and, unsurprisingly, France. The Indigenous peoples of Canada have their own distinctive cuisines, though these have not caught on with the majority of Canadians due to the use of exotic ingredients (e.g., bannock, bison, deer, muktuk), and you will often have to travel to their respective areas in order to sample these. Nevertheless, Indigenous restaurants are also becoming more common in the cities. One peculiar tradition that you may notice in nearly every small town is the Chinese-Canadian restaurant. A lot of the reason for this is the role Chinese immigration played historically in the early settlement of Canada, particularly in the building of the trans-continental railway. These establishments sell the usual fast-food Chinese cuisine. American visitors will find this cuisine familiar, as it developed in parallel with a virtually identical version in the States. In Toronto and Vancouver, two large centres of Chinese immigration, one can find authentic Chinese cuisine that rivals that of Hong Kong. In both cities, the original Chinatowns have been eclipsed by newer China"

The area around the airport is generally safe and well guarded but use common sense while carrying your luggage outside the airport. Sex Staying safe for adults can also require an understanding of the sexual climate of Peru. In general Peru is a relatively conservative country in the sense of male and female roles, but at the same time Peruvians are extremely open to friendships with foreigners. Thus, some men can find themselves suddenly the object of flirtation by attractive young Peruvian women, but then be suddenly rejected for having violated some unwritt"

If you cannot get local currency, you might want to bring cash in a currency that is easily exchanged at your destination - your Faroese banknotes will hardly be recognised in Peru, and Peruvian sols can be difficult to exchange in the Faroe Islands. You may not want to bring all the currency you need on your trip in cash, provided it is possible to use a credit or debit card at your destination. Check whether you need to inform your bank of your travels or change account settings, as sudden usage of your card in a foreign country may be interpreted as the card being used by someone else than you, and the card being blocked as a security precaution. Also, know that the risk of your card information getting into wrong hands may be greater than at home.

What is Hiking and backpacking in Israel famous for?,"y in some cases, so do not delay after the symptoms appear. Sandflies carrying leishmania The sandfly, pretty much indistinguishable from any normal housefly, is sometimes a carrier for the leishmania parasites which nest under your skin and cause leishmaniasis, nicknamed in Hebrew Shoshanat Yericho - literally ""Jericho Rose"". It's so called because it was common mainly in the Jordan Valley and the Jericho region, though nowadays it can (uncommonly) be found in most regions of Israel. The ""Rose"" part derives from the appearance of the fly bite; it looks like a mosquito bite, only it stays there for months, and every once in a while bursts out with blood. In Israel it usually results in nothing more than a really ugly scar, but in very rare cases - primarily in people with previous health conditions - it can cause permanent damage and even death, if the parasites nest internally. Treatment is very advisable, both for a faster healing of the blistering wound and to minimize the remaining scar. Consult a doctor, who would probably advise the use of some ointment.

The river responded to this shortcut by changing course completely, and over the years the canal has become the 30m wide and 10m deep main course of the river seen today. In 1757, Mon people from southern Myanmar were permitted to settle in areas around the Chao Phraya, including Ko Kret and adjacent Pak Kret.

Remains are still visible pretty much in every part of the city, even the outskirts, especially in Citadel Park. Yet during 19th century multiple new districts (Jezyce, St. Lazarus, Wilda) sprouted to the west and south of the city dominated by Art Nouveau buildings.

Give me travel tips for Ouvéa.,"Travel tips: French people. Expect to be greeted by anyone you will meet on the road. Talk Most of the population speaks French, and basic English. There are many Japanese signs too (virtually everything in the tourist infrastructure is translated to English and Japanese). Uniquely in New Caledonia, Ouvea has a native Polynesian population that speaks Fagauvea, a relative of the language spoken on the island of Wallis (`Uvea) thousands of miles to the east. The Melanesian Iaai language is also spoken. Get in By plane By ferry There are no scheduled ferry services to Ouvea. Betico runs occasional services from Noumea (6 hours), often via neighboring Lifou. By boat Unlike neighboring Lifou, cruise ships rarely visit Ouvea, and a much publicized incident in 2019 where angry locals confronted a luxury yacht fishing in protected waters led to a temporary moratorium on yacht visits too.

Tell me something about Zambia.,"dex finger should not be done, it is considered vulgar. Finally, when meeting a Zambian - even to ask a question - you should always say hello and ask how they are. Properly greeting a Zambian is very important. They are uncomfortable with the Western notion of simply ""getting to the point."" Enquiries about children are generally welcome and are a good way to break the ice. Connect By mail The Zambian mail service is slow and a little flaky (especially outside Lusaka), but not completely hopeless. Using a private courier service is still recommended if sending something important. By phone The country code for Zambia is ""260."" The city code for Lusaka is ""211"".

In large cities, you are more likely to get regular, dependable phone service, but it is by no means a guarantee.

What is Japan famous for?,"in gift shops and stores throughout the country. Keep them in your purse or pocket, and wipe your brow when necessary. Rain umbrellas are often cheap plastic, and available at every convenience store for about Y=500. Since they all look alike, they're sometimes treated as a communal resource. When you go in a store, you leave yours at the door, and when you leave, you simply grab an identical one, whether or not it was the one you brought. Some stores instead have bags to keep your umbrella from dripping on the floor. Hostels usually have umbrellas to lend, as do some other lodgings and businesses. Rather than toting your own umbrella around, you may find it more convenient to buy a cheap one (if you even need to), ""donate"" it to your hostel, and buy a new one in your next city. Religion Religious freedom is respected by most Japanese, and people of all faiths are generally able to practise their religion without any major problems.

During the Middle Ages, there were three powerful kingdoms - Kolathiri/Cherakal in the extreme north, Samuthiri/Zamorin in Calicut (north and central), Travancore in the south. The Portuguese were the first to discover a direct sea route between Lisbon and Calicut in Kerala, and this marked the beginning of European colonisation in the country. Soon the Dutch, French, Italians and British were all lured by the wealth of spices and silk, and came with the intention of forming colonies. The defeat of the Dutch by the Travancore Army at the Battle of Colachel, and the decline of Portuguese Empire and French problems in Europe, resulted in the British gaining the full influ"

Understand Kinugawa Onsen, known as the ""okuzashiki"" (Ao Zuo Fu ) or ""inner salon"" of Tokyo, was opened to development in the early Meiji period, and it became a major destination for those wanting to escape the noise and congestion of the city.

The exact provenance is unclear, but the most likely explanation is that this comes from the raging waters within -- although the river is now dammed and considerably more placid. The central area is home to several hotels and ryokan, most with their own hot springs. Unfortunately, due to a decline in group tours and the failure of the area's regional bank, Ashikaga Bank, in the late 1990s, several of the larger hotels have gone under, and their empty hulks scar an otherwise picturesque location: in 2005, the bestselling book Ugly Japan proclaimed it the 3rd ugliest place in the country.

Though the festive mood is spread everywhere in Kerala, the focal point of Onam celebrations happens in Kochi. The 10 day festival starts off with Aathachamayam (The Royal Parade on Aatham Day) in Thripunithara (a suburb of Kochi City). The Parade is extremely colour and depicts all the elements of Kerala culture with more than 50 floats and 100 tableaux. The main center of festival is at Thrikakkara temple within Kochi City, believed to be the ancient capital of King Mahabali. The Temple festival also marks the start of Onam. The festival is celebrated in memory of the mythical King Mahabali and his reign, during which perfect harmony and prosperity prevailed. The King Mahabali's popularity was at its height and led to the envy of the Gods. This golden age ended when Vamana, the dwarf incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu, expelled him from his throne to the netherworld. On account of his virtue, Mahabali was allowed to visit his subjects once a year, during Onam. Though the m"
Tell me something about Brazilian Portuguese phrasebook.,"brow university professors will even thus use vosso/vossa and convosco in class). Since this eliminates much of the grammar-based formality, to be formal, replace you with o senhor (oh sen-YOUR) for a man, a senhora (ah sen-YOUR-ah) for a woman, and a senhorita (ah sen-your-REE-tah) for a young unmarried lady. This can also be done just before their name (equivalent to Mr., Mrs., and Miss respectively), or it can be spoken by itself initially (with or without a name) in order to get someone's attention. Dropping the plural Informal speech in Brazil may avoid the plural altogether by using a gente (the people) for we and todo mundo (everybody) for they. Both forms use 3rd person singular. There's a subtle difference between todo mundo (everybody) and todo o mundo (all the world). Outside Brazil, toda a gente substitutes todo mundo. Unfortunately, this isn't much of a shortcut, as the we form is by far the easiest, and the they form is still needed for objects. It is also becoming common to see people dropping the final S in the nouns as it happens in French. So words like ""as"

There are many companies and taxis that provide a great service doing airport transfers to Negril. Get around The least expensive way to get around is to hire ""Route Taxis"".

Tent and camping gear -- While you'll find some kind of accommodation (mostly family-run guesthouses) in some villages (usually separated from each other by a distance of an average daily walk) along most of the route, there are two sections where wild camping is your only choice for two nights in a row. Even if you don't plan to hike such a section, camping is a great way to reduce your accommodation costs and having camping gear at hand gives much more freedom: Who wants to walk the further 5km to the guesthouse you plan to overnight while you are totally exhausted and are standing against a gorgeous view?

Is Scuba diving worth visiting?,"but non-technical diving is from day-boats, as the sites of interest are usually a few miles from the dive centre, and too far from shore to swim to. Day trips typically head out in the morning, when the sea is quieter, for a ""two-tank dive"", i.e. two dives with a surface interval between. With short travel times they return to base in that interval, with longer times they make a day of it at sea. Boats vary greatly in size and facilities, so the newly-arrived visitor should ask about this, to understand what to bring and what not to bring. The most spartan are small boats or RIBs (rigid inflatable boats) with outboard motors. You will already be in your wet- or drysuit on boarding, with kit assembled. Everything is liable to get drenched and there's no space for more than a small tote-bag for sunhat and glasses. Boats for longer trips are progressively roomier, with a wet deck where the kit stays and divers assemble, toilets and showers, and indoor and sun-deck dry areas. They may offer a catered lunch, snacks, and help yourself to coffee. They may carry several parties of experien"

Tell me something about Texas Panhandle.,"The northwest corner of Texas is known as the Texas Panhandle, probably because it juts out in stark plaintiveness from the rest of the state. Flat and dry, the steady prevailing winds can sometimes create mild dust storms, though modern farming techniques have much reduced the terrible dust storms which occurred during the ""Dust Bowl Days"" of the Great Depression. The region is subject to extremes of temperature like much of the Great Plains. Temperatures regularly reach 100oF (38oC) during the summer, while the winters can bring snows and the occasional blizzard. While the snows are not frequent, the prevailing winds can drive what little does drop across a large area of the plains until it finds something to pile up against, usually a town or city or a highway.

The most significant parking issue in the municipal limits of Beaver Falls itself (as opposed to Eastvale, West Mayfield, etc.) is street sweeping: each city street is swept overnight once per week, and if you leave your car on a street on the night that it's scheduled to be swept, a significant fine will be levied. Signs with the sweeping schedule are posted all over the place, so you won't need to wonder about a specific spot's schedule. Avenues and streets in each part of the city are rarely or never swept on the same night, so you should always be able to park your car a block or two away on street-sweeping night without fear of a ticket.

Such pieces are not played all night, but now and then among ballroom dances or more energetic disco pieces, often more frequently towards the end of the night.

The abbey became a cultural and religious centre for the County of Holland, in the early Middle Ages. The fishing village of Egmond aan Zee was founded in 977, and was later controlled by the abbey. The (Catholic) abbey was destroyed during the (Protestant) Dutch Revolt, by the troops of Diederik Sonoy. The ruins survived until about 1800. The present Benedictine abbey was built in the mid-1930s, another religious building (partly) designed by the traditionalist architect Kropholler. It is named after Saint Adelbert, an early missionary to the region. Monasteries typically derive income from craft work by the monks. In this case, the abbey makes candles: it is the only maker of religious candles in the country. There is a candle shop - Abdijkaarsen, Vennewatersweg 27, 1935 AR Egmond-Binnen. Tel: 0"

Tell me something about Minority cultures of Japan.,"Tokugawa Shogunate implemented a strict policy of isolationism, minor exceptions were made for Dutch and Chinese merchants, who were permitted to set up trading posts at Nagasaki, albeit with their movements severely restricted by law. Due to this long Chinese presence, the local cuisine of Nagasaki exhibits particularly strong Chinese influences, and the city is also known for having a high concentration of Chinese temples. During the Meiji and Taisho periods, as Japan became the first non-Western country to industrialise, many Chinese people made their way to Japan to study and bring back advanced knowledge, as Japan was both culturally and geographically closer to China than the Western countries, and much cheaper too; Sun Yat-sen, the founding president of the Republic of China, had studied in Japan. Moreover, many Taiwanese, both indigenous and Han Chinese, were brought to Japan as indentured laborers during Japanese colonial rule over the island (1895-1945).

Because of the region's history battling SARS (and later dealing with avian flu (H5N1)), good personal hygiene is strongly advisable. Although Macau's healthcare system is adequate for routine consultations, the lack of properly trained specialists and facilities means that you will be most likely referred to Hong Kong for more serious issues.

Sikh Gurduwaras (places of religious service) will have large kitchens and community dining halls, which will offer free meals to all people, regardless of faith, class, ability, or gender.

Regardless, Sikhism is still largely concentrated in the Punjab region of both countries, though there are Sikh diasporas in many parts of the world, most notably the United Kingdom, Canada, Eastern Australia and Malaysia. You will notice the mention of yoga and meditation below. That's because both disciplines were highly developed in ancient times by Hindu and Buddhist masters, so that while many types of meditation exist and yoga nowadays is often practiced outside of Hindu and Buddhist countries in a non-religious manner, the origins of yoga and at least the most influential styles of meditation are in these dharmic religions."

What is Ulaanbaatar famous for?,"of any Asian city, this generally applies less to the city center than the underdeveloped ger districts on the outskirts of town: poorly lit shantytowns crisscrossed by maze-like dirt alleys and row upon row of fences; not the kind of place most tourists would be interested in to begin with. Nonetheless, it might be a good idea to avoid going out at night alone (though it's usually perfectly fine to do so in groups). This goes double for relatively deserted areas away from major routes, and for rowdy nightlife districts. Although most large buildings have security guards, they're only there to keep drunks and homeless people out, so don't expect much help from them if a crime is committed against you.

Try not to display conspicuous wealth such as large amounts of cash or expensive cameras, mobile phones and other items as it may tempt thieves including children and may also encourage requests for financial assistance in some circumstances. Dress modestly in rural villages, religious sites and government buildings; long pants for men and a shirt, a modest skirt, full or calf length pants, dress or sarongs are suggested and a conservative blouse is recommended for women. This may save you or onlookers from embarrassment. If more revealing clothing is worn it is good to have a sarong handy as it can effect a quick and easy adaptation to prevailing circumstances.

When Kwajalein island started to be used as a support base for the nuclear tests conducted at Bikini Atoll and Enewetak Atoll, Marshallese residents of Kwajalein were relocated by U.S. authorities to a small, planned community constructed on Ebeye, which was largely unpopulated and had served as a Japanese seaplane base before the Pacific War. With the advent of the anti-ballistic missile testing program of the 1960s, the U.S. military decided for safety and security reasons to evacuate slightly more than 100 residents of the central part of the atoll to create a zone where unarmed guided missiles could be targeted from the continental United States.

Signage on the roads in Hong Kong is similar to British usage. Zebra lines (zebra crossings) indicate crossing areas for pedestrians and traffic comes from the right. To stay safe, visit the Transport Department's website for complete details. For crossing without any traffic control, local people usually wait for vehicles to pass first. Vehicles are not required to let pedestrians cross first. Crossing the road by foot should also be exercised with great care. Traffic in Hong Kong generally moves fast once the signal turns green.

What can I do in Rome?,"Things to do: are more than willing to help you get around and usually provide easier ways to get around. Some residents still speak the ancient local dialect, Romanesco; nowadays, however, Italian is the more common mother tongue. English is widely spoken in Rome by the younger generations and by people working in the tourist industry who often switch to English if you start a conversation in broken Italian. Since many people have a limited knowledge of English, it is wise to speak slowly and simply. Among 40+s the chance is a lot less, and with 60+s as good as zero. Romance languages other than Italian, especially Spanish, Portuguese and French, are also fairly widely understood due to their similarity to Italian, although not necessarily spoken. Buy Rome has excellent shopping opportunities of all kinds - from clothing and jewellery to art and antiques. You also get some big department stores, outlets and shopping centres, notably in the suburbs and outskirts. Main shopping areas include Via del Corso, Via Condotti, and the surrounding streets.

Is Buffalo/East Side worth visiting?,"city line in areas that were still considered desirable; those were reserved for whites only, while the nominally integrated but de facto all-black Willert Park served to further concentrate poverty in the city's most blighted district, worsening the problem it intended to solve. As in the rest of Buffalo, the urban renewal campaign accelerated after the war: it was in 1959 when three dozen city blocks of the old Ellicott District (bounded by Michigan Avenue, William Street, Jefferson Avenue, and Swan Street) were completely leveled, with a massive new series of public housing developments promised -- but with the exception of the Towne Gardens high-rises, the majority of that land remained vacant for over a decade afterward, a ""72-acre wasteland in the heart of the city"" according to a particularly scathing editorial in the Buffalo Courier-Express. But the coup de grace came in 1960, when the tree-lined median of Olmsted's Humboldt Parkway was eviscerated to make way for the Kensington Expressway, a noisy intrusion that tore the heart out of Hamlin Park and Humboldt Park and left t"
Tell me something about Thailand.,"illegal in Thailand except for stays of more than 30 days. The best prices (30-50% off rack rates) for accommodation can be found during Thailand's low season, which is during May-Aug, which not surprisingly also coincides with the region's monsoon season. The peak season is during Dec-Feb. The prices listed are average for the country, and vary depending on the region and season. Smaller provincial towns will not have fancy hotels or resorts, while on popular island beaches it may be hard to find something cheaper than 300-400 baht even during the low season. Another issue for westerners to be conscious of, is the unusual bathroom set up found almost everywhere, except perhaps in the four and five star hotels. In Thailand as in other Asian countries as well, the bathrooms even in many new and well kitted out establishments, tend to have the shower system without any kind of water isolation, be it a curtain or door or whatever, to prevent water splashing all over the place. To most, this is quite irritating as a simple floor water containment and drainage with some shower curtain"

Is Jimei worth visiting?,"tral Jimei to important places on Xiamen Island like SM Plaza, Xiamen Railway Station and Xiamen University. Taxis are another alternative. Going from right downtown on Xiamen Island to the far side of Jimei could run well over Y=100, but most trips would be less. In particular, Xiamen airport is on the North side of the island, close to Jimei, and a run from there to central Jimei might be only around Y=40. Get around Jimei is a fairly small place, and most interesting sights are usually in walking distance from each other. Nevertheless, there are many ways to get around for longer distances. A cheap and efficient way to get around is to use the local bus system. Jimei has the same bus system as Xiamen, so there are mostly modern buses that run often. However, there is almost no English signage, so it can be hard to get around if you can't read Chinese. It can be harder to find a taxi in Jimei then on Xiamen Island, but they still exist.

Describe North America.,"ed virtually all parts of North America. Except a short-lived Viking colony around AD 1000, the Americas were isolated from the rest of the world until the voyages of Columbus from 1492, and the subsequent wave of colonization, where first Spain, and later France, the British Empire and the Russian Empire seized parts of the continent. The Caribbean was divided between several European countries; in addition to the aforementioned, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark had island colonies. The United States became independent in 1776, was the first country outside the United Kingdom to industrialize (see American Industry Tour), expanded westwards during the 19th century to dominate the continent (see Old West), and became the world's undisputed dominant power by the middle of the 20th century.

Earthquakes Earthquakes that are large enough to cause extensive damage are rare, but remain a matter of reality for the state. Most earthquakes are mild and last for a couple of seconds. You're not likely to encounter one during your trip, but if you do, you'll probably go home with nothing more exciting than a story about it being over before you figured out that it was an earthquake. When you feel the shaking, act quickly to drop, cover, and hold on. The biggest dangers in an earthquake are falling objects (such as books or bottles flying off shelves - or the whole shelf with all of its contents, if it's not properly mounted) and windows, which may shatter explosively. In the event of an earthquake, face away from windows and hide under any sturdy table or desk - an"

Give me travel tips for Mesa Verde National Park.,"Travel tips: particularly in summer. By mid-morning you should be prepared for at least an hour long wait for a place in a tour group. Be forewarned that each tour does involve traversing uneven stairways and tall wooden ladders.

Is German phrasebook worth visiting?,"vor zwanzig"" sounds unidiomatic) Expressing ""fractional hours"" differs slightly among various regions. The ""normal"" way of doing it is: Quarter past one (01:15) - Viertel nach eins or Viertel zwei Half past one (01:30) - Halb zwei (half two) A quarter to two (01:45) - Viertel vor zwei or Dreiviertel zwei The latter form is common in Eastern Germany, Bavaria, and Austria, although the former is universally understood but not without causing cringes. Outside these regions, many have trouble understanding the latter form. Usually Germans who don't understand you will ask and saying the number (11:45 ""elf Uhr funfundvierzig"") is sure to get the confusion out of the way, though it may sound somewhat stilted and bureaucratic.

Tell me something about Croatia.,"uly-August tourist season, be prepared for congestion at key border crossings and on the roads leading to the coast. Roads in Croatia are usually well maintained, but can be very narrow and full of curves. Some local roads in Istria have been worn down to a smooth surface from regular wear and tear, and can be extremely slippery when wet. Highways with more than one lane per direction (motorways) tend to connect major cities and can be well out of the way even for some longer routes such as to Plitvice. Speed limits outside motorways are thus low (60-90 km/h), and it's not recommended to drive faster (although most locals do), especially at night. Beware of animals crossing the road. In case you want to overtake a slow vehicle on a narrow road, often the drivers in front of you will flash their right yellow turning lights and drive all the way on the right to signal the drivers behind that it is okay to overtake. But this is at your own risk. Renting a car is around the same price as in the EU (from around ). Almost all cars have a manual transmission. Most rental agencies in the"

Tell me something about Iraq.,"spitable parts of Iraq and strict preparations are necessary. By bus Bus travel is a popular choice for locals to travel between Iraq and neighboring countries, especially from Iran.

How can I travel to Dutch phrasebook?,"you're trying to practice your Dutch, and most people will make an effort to converse with you in simple Dutch. If you attain a basic fluency in Dutch, you will find that many people will converse with you in Dutch despite your foreign accent. Differences between Flemish and Dutch in Europe In Flanders, it is much more common to use the polite form to address others than in the Netherlands, where the formal ""u"" is nowadays mostly reserved to address elderly people. However, since it could be a problem to use the casual form where the polite form is due, and the opposite might simply invoke some giggles, we use the polite form in this phrasebook unless mentioned otherwise. The pronunciation of the g differs greatly between the south (Flanders and the Southern Netherlands) and the north. In the north, the /g/ is pronounced as a voiceless velar fricative; much like the traditional pronunciation of the English word ""loch"". In Dutch, this is called the ""harde g"" or ""hard g"". South of the Rhine and Waal rivers, the pronunciation shifts to a palatal fricative, or a ""soft g"" - a less com"

It is advisable to refer to Poland (as well as to some other countries like the Czech Republic, Slovakia, or Hungary) as Central (+""and Eastern"", if needed) Europe, and not only ""Eastern Europe"". Although not very offensive, ""Eastern Europe"" is old fashioned, harking back to the Iron Curtain times, thus some folks will be extra happy if you stick to ""Central Europe"", which is also used in scientific literature. As for the language matters: Poles cherish their language as they had to struggle hard to protect it during the long spells when under the foreign yoke: the Partitions of Poland and WWII.

Both Lovejoy and Pettygrove wanted to name the new town after their respective hometowns; so in 1845 they decided to leave it up to a coin toss and Pettygrove won two times out of three. In 1851, Portland was incorporated and was growing rapidly; its proximity to the rivers, which funneled a trade with San Francisco to the south, combined by the local fishing, lumber, and agriculture industries fueled Portland's early growth. The railroad arrived in the 1880s, and for a time Portland was the largest city on the west coast north of San Francisco; however the Klondike Gold Rush and the arrival of the railroad to Washington state meant Seattle quickly eclipsed Portland's growth.

What can I do in Sudan?,"Things to do: roup of travellers, the more economical these rooms are, as more beds are often put in a room (within reason) to accommodate everybody without the price being changed. Some hotels have cheaper beds outside in the open as in smaller towns and cities. These hotels are not very clean but are cheap and perfectly acceptable for short stays. Lower mid-range hotels - more likely to be found in Khartoum - offer the worst value for money. They may have en suite bathrooms, (mostly evaporative) air conditioning and satellite television, but for what you're paying (two or three times that of basic hotels depending on your bargaining skills) the rooms are extremely tatty and hotel owners will almost always subscribe to the philosophy of: 'Only fix something if the guest complains'. There will sometimes be rooms minus the bathroom/air conditioning/television for prices a little above those in basic hotels. Upper mid-range hotels are the next step up, with spotless rooms of a far higher quality but prices (usually quoted in dollars) closer to what you'd expect in the West. You'll have little to f"
What is Meditation in Japan famous for?,"e most well known overseas, and in many ways Zen and Japanese culture are synonymous. Japanese gardens, tea ceremony and martial arts were all either direct expressions of the Zen spirit or were greatly influenced by it. Perhaps as a result of its overseas fame, the majority of overseas visitors who come to Japan to study meditation will do so at a Zen monastery. The other school that has attracted some overseas interest is Shingon, though not to the same extent as Zen. Many monasteries offer multi-day meditation courses for the lay community, though only a few cater to non-Japanese speakers. Below is a list of those that have provision for overseas visitors. This list serves only as a 'pointer.' More detailed information is available on the city or prefecture article where the temple is located. Prepare Few monasteries entertain trainees who arrive without prior notice, so it is important to first contact the monastery to discuss your plans. This can be done by written correspondence or phone. Some monasteries do not charge guests, though many do. Check the nightly rate before m"

It is an agricultural community that is not a common tourist destination. Understand Heavily agricultural, with a population of some 12,000 in 2022, Erabu is densely populated by Amami standards, but the population declined from 14,500 in 2001. Known as Yirabu in the local dialect, the island is likely named after the black-banded sea krait, a common local sea snake. Oki no means ""in the open sea"", since it's 60 km north of the Okinawan mainland, and this helps distinguish it from Irabu in the Miyako Islands.

Give me travel tips for Aswan.,"Travel tips: ships have a reception at their entrance and you can just walk in. Do not mind the guards or barriers, they are just there for protection. According to some travellers, prices can start at US$40 per night. Either way, it will be cheaper than when going through an agent or booking online. Buy The souqs (markets) in Aswan are refreshingly exotic without the same level of high-pressure selling found in some tourist towns like Luxor. You will generally find that Nubian handicrafts are of higher quality and better value in Aswan. All other goods will be more expensive than in Cairo due to shipping costs to Aswan and the lower tourist demand. Eat Budget City centre South Aswan Mid-range Splurge Drink Aswan is much less strict on drinking alcohol than Cairo or Luxor, and many of the restaurants sell Stella (Egyptian brand not the Belgian brand) and Saqqara, both of which are lagers and comparable to European beers.

There are two types of train you can use; normal, slow, type of train equipped with beds, and the so-called new 'Intercity' type which is more expensive because of a 'quality supplement fee' that grows with distance. For example, travelling from Athens to Thessaloniki by the 'Intercity' type will save one hour at most, but the ticket will be almost twice the price.

How can I travel to Mobile phones?,"codes: for the phone, for using the SIM and for privileged configuration (of the SIM). These are set independently of each other. The SIM works by a PIN, the phone may provide fingerprint authorization or face authentication to access its features. The SIM PIN may be blank or trivial (0000, 1234) unless set to something else. These may also be preset by the provider with several random digits and given to you in a sealed envelope or packet. If you use a memory card without encryption, the card can be read and used once it is put in another device. If you lock your phone and SIM and forget your PINs, getting them unlocked can be more trouble than you'd like. Knowing the phone's PIN but forgetting the SIM's PIN, you may still access your phone but you may not be able to make calls or access mobile data. The phone can usually be reset to factory defaults, losing any information (such as contacts and photos) you stored on it. The SIM card has a PUK code, which can be used to reset the PIN. Usually you either get the PUK with the SIM or the provider keeps it and tells it when needed. Go"

Is Kars worth visiting?,"Kars is a city in Eastern Anatolia. It is most frequently visited as a jumping off point for travelers going to Ani, but it is a viable destination in its own right for its 19th-century Russian imperial buildings, and, of course, its role as the setting for Orhan Pamuk's famous novel Snow.

What is Planning your flight famous for?,"he secure area of the terminal at the connecting airport, claim your checked baggage, re-check it on your continuing flight, and again go through security check to reach the gate for your next flight. This requires considerable time. Check with the airline regarding any such fee and the need for extra time for flights you find interesting. Answers may be cause for you to look for other arrangements. If you book separate flights on separate tickets (especially on different airlines), making the connection is solely your responsibility. If you are flying on an airline or fare type that doesn't permit last minute changes, you may lose your fare when one airline's delay makes you late for the next one. Paying a little more for a flexible fare on the final connection may not only avoid this risk, but can also let you catch an earlier flight if you make the connection ahead of schedule.

Elk Island is Canada's only entirely fenced national park, and home to Canada's most famous herds of wild bison, also known as ""buffalo"" (but not closely related to the Eastern hemisphere's water buffalo or African buffalo). These two herds are used as breed stock to repopulate other famous parks, in Canada (for example, Banff National Park in 2017), the USA (Yellowstone) and even Russia. Elk Island is a small park by Canadian standards at 194 km2 (75 sq mi) and is an ""island"" (metaphorically, only) of protected forest surrounded by farmland.

Describe Austro-Hungarian Empire.,"of Austria in 1282. From 1438 to 1806 the dynasty almost continually held the titles of German king and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. From 1516 to 1700, the Habsburgs also controlled the vast Spanish Empire. Ferdinand I of Austria was elected King of Bohemia (now in the Czech Republic) in 1526 and annexed Hungary in the same year, thereby also acquiring Croatia and Slovakia. While the Protestant Reformation swept northern Europe, Austria remained Catholic. In the early 17th century, Protestant states revolted against the Holy Roman Empire. The conflict evolved to the Thirty Years' War, in which the Holy Roman Emperor lost all significant power outside Austria and Bohemia. The multiethnic Habsburg Monarchy, lying partly within and partly outside the Empire, became a great power in its own right, and a destination on the Grand Tour. Vienna became a centre for European classical music and other arts, boasting composers such as Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert. Following the 1789 French Revolution, the Kingdom of France became Austria's main rival in the French Revolutionar"

Give me travel tips for Bay Area public transit.,"Travel tips: y buses, the fare varies by distance traveled. So you need to tap the card twice - upon beginning and ending your ride - so that you are charged the correct fare. (If you forget to ""tap out"" at the end of your Caltrain ride, you may be charged a higher fare.) On other buses, you only need to tap when you get on. Ask the driver if you're not sure, or look at what other passengers are doing. Transfers Sometimes when you transfer from one public-transit vehicle to another (e.g., from BART to a bus) the fare for the second ride is discounted. Procedures vary by transit agency. In some cases, the discount is applied automatically (if you used the card for both rides). In others, you can save money by requesting a paper transfer. Ask the vehicle operator or station agent which procedure applies. Can I just tap a credit card instead? Hopefully soon! Starting in late August 2025, BART gates will let passengers tap on and off with a contactless credit or debit card, and if all goes well this option will eventually be extended to all systems that use Clipper.

To avoid rip tides, don't swim between the shoreline and underwater sand bars, don't swim during low tide, and pay attention to the color-coded flags.

The ""Land of a thousand lakes"" has thousands of islands too, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos. In the archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.

This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one to forty).

The railways began as a leash of company tracks between mines and wharves, then long distance routes were forged. Three sections linked in 1850 to create the East Coast Mainline from London Kings Cross to Edinburgh: Doncaster is about midway and became a railway engineering centre. Much of the industry has gone, with the better coal seams worked out, engineering jobs lost abroad, and limited investment in the railways. Doncaster transitioned to service and light industry. This area, historically part of West Riding of Yorkshire, in 1974 joined the new entity of South Yorkshire, along with Sheffield, Barnsley and Rotherham.

Tell me something about Street art in Melbourne.,"One of the underlying features that gives Australia's most populous city, Melbourne, its cosmopolitan vibes, is its street art. With many of its alleyways in the CBD designated for street art, it has proved itself to be the Australian street art capital, popular among photographers. Understand There is perhaps no other district in Australia like that found in Australia's largest city - even Newtown in Sydney's Inner West isn't comparable.

How can I travel to Malawi?,"y of being courteous. Accept their hospitality. They are an exceptionally friendly people. Malawians, especially those from very rural areas where they don't see many whites, can be quite curious when they do come upon a white traveller. To a Western mindset, this might be interpreted as unnecessarily staring at you or talking about you in front of you. Be prepared to be greeted by kids yelling mzungu, mzungu! and to answer lots of questions about yourself. Even relatively mundane items like mechanical pencils can draw a crowd of onlookers. Malawians are in general extremely courteous, and a part of that courtesy is shaking hands, speaking softly, and referring to travellers and others with respect. Malawians avoid rudeness. It is common for Malawi men to hold hands when they've gathered together to chat, and this shouldn't be given a sexual interpretation when it is encountered.

How can I travel to New Zealand?,"Zealand accent is mostly non-rhotic (i.e. no rolling r sound after vowels), except in the lower half of the South Island where the rhotic ""Southland burr"" accent persists due to high Scottish immigration in the region's early days. The most noticeable difference in the New Zealand accent compared to other accents is the pronounced shift in the short-i (as in kit) and the short-e (as in dress) sounds; the short-i sound has moved towards schwa (the a in ""comma"") whereas the short-e has moved towards where the short-i was. This is can be best highlighted in the phrase ""eating fish 'n' chips on my deck"", which can be interpreted by foreigners (especially Australians) as ""eating fush 'n' chups on my dick"". Another noticeable difference is the New Zealand bear-beer-bare merger, so words like ""air"" and ""ear"", ""bear"" and ""beer"", ""chair"" and ""cheer"", and ""fairy"" and ""ferry"" are almost identical in pronunciation, leading to the odd joke about an inebriated Goldilocks.

They range from 1 - 5 stars. 5 star hotels are normally for package tourism or business travel, and very common outside of Lima for most visited tourist attractions such as Cuzco/Machu Picchu with amazing landscapes, Paracas (to flight over the Nazca Lines), Tumbes with great beach resorts, and of course in Lima with international and Peruvian companies. All of them under international standards and expensive, but really worthwhile to try them. 4 star hotels are usually a bit on the expensive side (>US$80 per night) and common in the large cities. 3 star hotels are a good compromise between price and quality and usually US$30-50. 2 and 1 star hotels are very cheap (<US$30), but don't expect hot water or a particularly safe neighborhood. In many cities there are hotels in residential areas, but they are not tourist hotels but ""couples"" rooms for lovers. They are usually signed as ""Hostel"", which can"
What is Historic churches of Buffalo's East Side famous for?,"ica was due in large part to the work of the great H. H. Richardson, who pioneered his namesake Richardsonian Romanesque substyle right here in Buffalo with its prototype design, the Buffalo State Hospital, erected in 1870. The style's heyday lasted through about 1900. In Buffalo, Romanesque Revival architecture was particularly popular among the Polish churches of Broadway-Fillmore that were built during the last quarter of the 19th century, as well as some of the later-period German churches. Romanesque Revival buildings are usually built of brick or stone--in Buffalo, Medina sandstone is especially popular--and have a stout, ponderous appearance distinctly at odds with the more delicate Gothic Revival style. Its major distinguishing feature is the round or semicircular arch, which is typically employed on all the windows and doorways of a building as well as serving as a decorative motif elsewhere. Richardsonian Romanesque typically uses the very similar Syrian arch instead. The columns that are typically employed around the entrance eschew less ornate orders such as the Doric an"

What are some attractions in Golf?,"r. China The Chinese claim to have invented golf in the 10th century, along with printing, chess, rockets, computing and everything else you can think of. This particular claim is unlikely since their emperors didn't pass laws banning it. Golf here was a colonial pastime, and Mao Zedong denounced it as a ""sport for millionaires"". (Since the Chinese yuan of his day was hyperinflated trash on a par with the Mexican peso, he may have been saying that golf was affordable by the masses.) Under communism it was disapproved of, or subject to outright bans, on a scale that suggests that all the party officials were playing it, or at least convening at the golf hotel to fix up crooked deals. In 2015 Article 87 of the Communist Party Disciplinary Regulations outlawed holding a golf membership card; this measure was designed to stamp out corruption, but apparently it didn't. Courses are concentrated around the old colonial stamping grounds of Hong Kong, Macao and Shenzhen, see Golf in China.

Tell me something about China.,"sport, and reauthorize it for each city. The driver usually prioritizes speed over comfort, so hold on tight. Coaches, or long-distance buses, may be more practical than trains for going to suburbs or smaller cities, though they are fiercely competed and often outperformed by trains. Coaches originating from larger cities on the east coast tend to be air conditioned with soft seats. Bus personnel tend to try to be helpful, but they are much less familiar with foreigners than airline personnel. A coach or bus in rural China is a different experience. Signs in the station to identify buses will be in Chinese. The coach's license plate number is printed on the ticket, it will be spray-painted on the back of the bus. Scheduled times of departure and arrival are only rough estimates, with the bus leaving when it's full, rather than at a scheduled time. Often, rural coaches are the only forms of transportation in many areas of China and are usually more than willing to stop anywhere along the route should you wish to visit more remote areas without direct transport. Buses can also be"

Describe Nicaragua.,"m. Immigrant communities are usually minor in size but the German-Nicaraguan community was economically important in the coffee business until Somoza expropriated them as a ""war measure"" in World War II (which Nicaragua ""fought"" on the allied side). Other immigrant communities include Chinese-Nicaraguans and Afro-Nicaraguans. Sizeable expat communities have arisen in cities like Granada, however, immigration was always and still is dwarfed by emigration. Because of economic and political reasons many Nicaraguans have left their country in the last decades - primarily to the US and Costa Rica. About 500,000 to one million Nicaraguans now live and work in Costa Rica, not all of them legally, which has caused tensions both on a personal and on a diplomatic level between the two countries. The Nicaraguan diaspora in the US consists of both political emigres not unlike the Cuban population of Miami and economic migrants. However, unlike its neighbors emigration to the US is neither as prevalent nor as culturally dominant a phenomenon as the presence of Latinos in the US might indicate."

What can I do in Travelling with a mental health condition?,"Things to do: rials or antibiotics, check with your doctor whether these could interfere with your condition or existing psychiatric medication, and arrange alternative medicine if necessary. If you are changing time zones significantly, ask your healthcare provider whether your schedule should change. When travelling for a long period of time, you will need to research treatment and medication that you can access in your destination. Check for special restrictions at your destination. Habit-forming drugs are frequent targets for country-by-country restrictions, and while most are okay at most destinations, the exceptions sometimes surprise people. For example, amphetamines such as Ritalin and Adderall are commonly used in the United States, but possession of these common medications is illegal in Japan. If you take medications for insomnia, anxiety, or attention difficulties, then it's best to check with your destination that your particular meds are okay. If you find that there's a problem, then talk to your doctor early about alternatives. Some medications can be ""paused"" without doing to"

What can I do in Toilets?,"Things to do: The daily need for a toilet can be a frustrating challenge for travellers.

Understand While one of human's most basic needs has to be taken care of no matter where you are, the way it is actually done can differ wildly from place to place, sometimes even within one country. From fancy self cleaning toilets in Japan to nothing more than what you bring with you to dispose of human waste or - well - a hole in the ground when leave-no-trace camping, there is a wide variety, that you should be at least aware of before heading out.

Is Working in China worth visiting?,"intended to stop people from evading taxes by being paid in multiple countries at the same time. There are strict controls and limits on moving currency out of China. Transferring a large amount of money to your home country requires substantial paperwork and may not be possible at short notice. Different expats have different preferred methods for getting money out of the country; all of them are inconvenient or expensive, and because the rules change frequently and are applied inconsistently, you never know for sure what will work until you try it. Even exchanging large amounts of Chinese yuan to foreign currency in cash may be difficult for foreigners. All of this is another reason that being paid in Hong Kong or Macau (or into a bank account back home) may be advantageous. Indeed, some expats send money home from mainland China by moving it through Hong Kong first. Your FAO or a Chinese bank can help you understand the rules. Some companies may encourage you to evade taxes by leaving part of your salary out of the contract and paying it to you in Hong Kong, in cash, or into an"

Landscape right|thumb|300px|Rainbow over the Middle Falls - Mr. Letchworth's ""Glen Iris"" Despite its nickname, the valley carved by the Genesee River doesn't really look like the Grand Canyon; visitors who've seen the real thing won't be very impressed by the comparison. For starters, it's much smaller in scale. At its widest point, the Grand Canyon is 18 miles (29 km) wide; Letchworth Park would just fit inside there--lengthwise! And the Grand Canyon's mile-high depth dwarfs the 300- to 500-foot-plus (100- to 150-meter-plus) walls of the Letchworth gorge. On the other hand, Letchworth has far more vegetation in and around the gorge, and it's fair to say there are few other gorges this side of the Mississippi that approach Letchworth in either size or beauty.

Describe Brooklyn.,"t the end of the nineteenth century, forever after lamented by Brooklynites as ""The Great Mistake of 1898."" Although Brooklyn is very diverse, what makes Brooklyn so different from the other boroughs are its distinct cultural neighborhoods. Manhattan is frequently referred to as ""the city"" by residents of the other boroughs -- for example, in the phrase ""I'm going to the city."" Many Brooklynites have a great deal of pride in their borough, and most New Yorkers consider Brooklynites to have an identity distinct from that of other New Yorkers. In any case, remember while speaking to Brooklynites that referring to Manhattan as ""the city"" is acceptable but calling Manhattan ""New York City"" is not. Visitor information Get in By subway From Manhattan Most lines pass through Downtown Brooklyn and stop at Atlantic Avenue - Barclays Center, the largest subway stop outside Manhattan. From here, you can transfer between and get to almost any destination in Brooklyn. You can also walk about two blocks north of the station to find Fulton Street and Lafayette Avenue stations. To use"

Give me travel tips for Visa.,"Travel tips: rposes. Citizens of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states may visit most other member states without a visa for business and tourism purposes. The United States allows certain nationals to enter under the Visa Waiver Program for tourism and business only, provided they fill out an online application prior to their arrival.

Describe Dengue fever.,"ing the second strain, gets confused and just makes lots of antibodies against the first. The fatality rate for DHF with proper treatment is below 1%, but it is a life-threatening illness which usually requires hospitalization, and often some time in an intensive care ward. Part of the problem is dehydration and the usual treatments for that can be used, but other treatment is generally required as well. This often involves major interventions - transfusions, other intravenous fluids, sometimes oxygen to compensate for blood or lung problems, perhaps medication to reduce bleeding, and so on.

There is usually a thermocline in summer, and the visibility may change significantly below the thermocline. The surface can be 18 or 19degC with 10 or 11degC at the bottom, but the difference is more likely to be 5degC or less.

Because the receipt comes from the bank counter and the client has signed for what is supposedly a cash advance, credit card companies (i.e. MasterCard) are reluctant to refund or complain against this particular (and very lucrative) merchant. The lesson for the tourist is to never let one's credit card out of one's hands, and even then in many places it is better to pay cash. Also, shops are less expensive after Customs than in the pre check-in lounge. Caveat emptor!

Tell me something about Solar eclipses.,"k taken out of the sun. Until this point, you've been planning and travelling and spending all for the sake of a mathematical prediction. Now here's the first physical proof that it's really going to happen. Partial eclipse: this is where you need eclipse-rated glasses or other protection, as described below. The eyes have a strong natural reflex to avoid being blinded by the sun. Your iris constricts, your eyelids close, you flinch and turn away. As the eclipse deepens, there's less light and the reflex can be overcome. You can gaze directly at the sun but at your peril, because damaging amounts of visible light, infra-red and ultra-violet are being focussed onto your retina. The damage may be permanent and severe. The weather: what's it doing? With perhaps 20 minutes to go, is the sun in a clear sky, are the clouds dragging over, does it look like you could realistically improve your viewing chances by moving a few miles? You are searching (probably along with several thousand frantic fellow-observers) for a good big hole in the cloud cover. A little chink is not worth chasing, i"

Tell me something about Igls.,"construction of the first hotels in the town. Igls rose to international fame through the Olympic Winter Games of 1964 and 1976 being organized on the slopes of the Patscherkofel. An ice bobsleigh track and Olympic ski run were constructed, and these facilities are still in use for international sports competitions such as the Youth Olympics of 2012. Igls is a victim of global warming: snowfall is diminishing year after year. Lack of snow has resulted in the closure and decommissioning of the Patscherkofelbahn base station which used to offer skiers a direct ascent onto the Patscherkofel from the heart of Igls. The new base station straddles the mountain a few km to the south-east, and with skiers passing through the town by bus instead of visiting, the future of the tourism sector in Igls is uncertain. Restaurants and night life have reduced their opening hours to compensate for the lack of patrons, but travellers with a keen eye can profit from the reduced demand for accommodation as hotel prices have also dropped significantly.

Automatic transmissions (voiture a boite automatique) are generally only used by the elderly or those with physical disabilities. This extends to vehicle categories that in other countries (read: the USA) are virtually never equipped with a manual transmission, such as vans and large sedans. Accordingly, virtually all of the vehicles available for rent at the average car hire will be equipped with a manual gearbox.

In many jurisdictions it is possible to make a prenuptial agreement to override much of what you may think is not fair or appropriate in case of divorce, and regarding heritages. In some jurisdictions a similar agreement is always made. There may be surprisingly strict requirements for paperwork. You may need to have documents such as birth certificates to get translated by an authorized or approved translator and sent to be handled by the consulate responsible for the region where they were issued, perhaps even to get your visa. You will also want to check any local customs. You will not want to be unprepared when the officiant asks about the dowry or the mahr, and you don't want to violate any local taboos. If you come from different traditions, make sure you know what both of you expect, and what guests will expect.

Describe Ubud.,"difficult to get around. As in most of Bali, in all but the grandest of hotels, check-in and check-out times are a bit of a moveable feast. It is safe to assume about 14:00 and 11:00. Budget Ubud has many homestays which are the cheapest form of lodging, a good way to meet the locals, and the natural replacement for hostels on the backpacker circuit. If you want to stay in town, the area around Jl Monkey Forest is generally the most expensive little more expensive (from Rp80,000-100,000 per night). If you want cheaper prices try the areas around Jl Hanoman, north of Jl Raya Ubud and further out in Peliatan. In the low season especially, bargains can be had by those willing to bargain.

Phnom Penh is malaria-free, and Siem Reap and Angkor Wat are virtually malaria-free. Malaria prophylaxis is recommended for most other places in the country. The biggest disease worry is mosquito-borne dengue fever which, although quite unpleasant, to say the least (it's called ""break-bone fever"" because of how it feels) g"

First bishop in Poland resided here and Early Piasts were buried in cathedral crypt.
